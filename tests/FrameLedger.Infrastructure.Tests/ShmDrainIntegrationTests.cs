/// <c>FlGuardedInject</c> is the ANTI-CHEAT gate; <c>fl_guard_abi.h</c> says in its own header that it

/// automatically.
/// </para>

/// Synthesising <c>HookEnabled = true, ConsentedAt = UtcNow</c> to satisfy that gate was also rejected:

/// The target here is <c>hook-harness</c> — our own dummy D3D app, built from this tree, carrying no
/// anti-cheat and belonging to no publisher. Injecting into it raises no consent question at all. The
/// test asserts that constraint on itself below, so this cannot quietly grow into something that
/// injects elsewhere.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>NO BUDGET IN THIS FILE IS SIZED ON THE HARNESS'S MEASURED RATE.</b> Four assertions were, and
/// all four went red under load while nothing was wrong — the suite runs four test assemblies in
/// parallel, each spawning a harness and injecting an Overlay that creates a WARP device, so the
/// presenting thread is descheduled for far longer than a rate-derived constant allows. Every loop
/// here waits for the STATE it needs, bounded by a wall clock generous enough to be about the state
/// rather than about the machine.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>And when one of them fails, capture the MESSAGE before changing anything.</b> #62 spent two
/// rounds applying the remedy for a race to what turned out to be a loop bound and its assertion
/// disagreeing by one — a defect class is a hypothesis about the next failure, never a diagnosis of
/// it. <c>TheGuardInjectsTheOverlayAndTheReaderDrainsRealFrames</c> failed once in twelve runs on
/// 2026-08-06 with its message uncaptured; its rate-sized budget was removed because that is
/// defensible on its own terms, and that is explicitly NOT presented as the fix for that occurrence.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>QPC ORDER ACROSS A LAP IS UNASSERTABLE IN EITHER DIRECTION, and it cost three attempts to say
/// so.</b> Measured both ways on 2026-08-06: under the full suite the drop test's first drained record
/// came back ~148 ms LATER than the second; run alone, the same batch was perfectly ascending. Both are
/// legal. <c>Drain</c> resumes at <c>writeIndex - capacity</c> — the oldest SURVIVOR — and whether the
