.SYNOPSIS
    Fails a pull request that changes shipped source without changing CHANGELOG.md.

.DESCRIPTION
    PRs #40–#44 landed with no changelog entry. #45 wrote them retrospectively and
    said so at length, in prose, at the top of the file. Then #46 through #52
    landed with no changelog entry either — seven more, including the C# struct
    mirror, the ring reader, the handshake validator, the closed write-read loop
    and check 3's call site.

    That is the finding this script exists for: a retrospective note is not a
    mechanism. The repository already had the sentence asking people to remember,
    and the sentence is what failed, twice, in one week.

    WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It cannot judge whether an entry is any good, or whether
    it describes the change that was actually made. It asserts one mechanical
    thing: that a diff touching src/ also touched the ledger. A one-word entry
    satisfies it. That is stated here rather than left for someone to discover,
    because a gate whose write-up claims more than it covers is this project's
    own recurring defect (20_OPEN_QUESTIONS, gates-that-cannot-fail).

    FAIL-CLOSED ON AN EMPTY LIST. A pull request with no changed files is not a
    thing; an empty list means the caller's query broke. Reporting "no src/
    changes, therefore fine" on an empty list would be a verdict decided before
    the check looked, so an empty list is a failure instead.

.PARAMETER ChangedFiles
    Repository-relative paths, as GitHub reports them for the pull request. The
    caller supplies them; this script does no git or API work of its own, so the
    logic below is drivable from -SelfTest without a network or a repository.

.PARAMETER SelfTest
    Runs the decision table below in BOTH directions and exits non-zero if any
    case comes out wrong. build.ps1 runs this on every check, so the gate's
    ability to go red is proven on every build rather than assumed — the same
    discipline tools/rules-validate.ps1 applies to its schema canary.

    Deliberately NOT a boolean: "the changelog is missing" and "the file list is
    empty, so nothing was checked" are different failures, and a caller that
    could only see true/false would report the second as the first.
