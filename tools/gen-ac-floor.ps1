.SYNOPSIS
    Generates the guard's compiled-in blocklist floor from rules/detection-rules.json.

.DESCRIPTION
    §S21 gave the guard a floor that a rules file may extend but never shrink. That
    floor was hand-written and deliberately minimal — the three families
    IsCompleteEnoughToGate already required — because a larger hand-written one
    would have been a second copy of the blocklist, drifting from the data.

    Measured 2026-08-04, that reasoning bought a floor covering 4 of the seed's 22
    values, 2 of its 5 groups and none of its 5 name fragments. So §S21 closed
    "a crafted rules file makes the guard allow everything" and left open
    "a crafted rules file removes most of the blocklist" — Denuvo, GameGuard,
    Xigncode3, mhyprot, FACEIT, ESEA, PunkBuster, EAC's directories and services,
    BattlEye's directories, Vanguard's service, and the whole fuzzy tier.

    That gap was tolerable while nothing delivered a rules file to any machine.
    §S20's seeder is what turns it into a push channel, so the floor grows to the
    whole shipped blocklist first.

    GENERATING it is what makes that safe. The objection to a large floor was
    drift, and a table derived from the data at build time cannot drift from it.

.NOTES
    Emits into the BUILD directory, never the source tree: generated code in
    src/native would be subject to clang-format (build.ps1 §clang-format excludes
    `build`), and a generated file under version control is a copy that can be
    edited independently — which is the thing this exists to prevent.
