.SYNOPSIS
    Resolve the upscaler/FG SDK symbols docs/17_HOOK_ENGINE.md names, against the
    vendor DLLs actually shipped by installed titles. Emits docs/vendor-exports.json.

.DESCRIPTION
    P0 item 5. `17_HOOK_ENGINE` §Upscaling records SDK *conventions* and says so:
    "Symbol names above are from vendor SDK conventions and must be verified
    against the actual exports on the dev machine during the P0 spike." A wrong
    name degrades silently to `unknown`, which reads as "working, no upscaler
    detected" — the highest false-confidence risk in the whole spike.

    PowerShell over dumpbin rather than a C++ probe, deliberately. This reads
    files on disk and never loads them; a native tool would buy nothing and would
    have to be built, shipped and kept off the injection surface.

.PARAMETER Roots
    Directories to search for installed titles.

.PARAMETER Out
    Where to write the JSON. Committed so the doc/data pair is reviewable.

# One entry per DISTINCT module name. Titles ship the same DLL repeatedly; the
# question is what a module of that name exports, not how many copies exist.
#
# THE UNION ACROSS COPIES, since 2026-09-04, and not the first copy found. Two
# generations of the same name coexist on this machine -- sl.interposer.dll 2.7.1
# beside 2.8.0, which added slSetTagForFrame -- and "what a module of that name
# exports" depends on which copy the walk happened to reach first. A row for a
# symbol only the newer generation exports would then pass or fail Pass A on
# directory order. Every distinct version is listed, so the oracle says which
# generations it saw; `version` keeps the first for the existing readers.
