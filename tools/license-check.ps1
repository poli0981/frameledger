#Requires -Version 7.0
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Licence guard. Fails the build on a licensing regression.

.DESCRIPTION
    Two checks, both from docs/18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS.md and
    legal/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md:

    1. No Intel IGCL or AMD ADLX material anywhere in the tree.

       These are rejected on licence grounds, not preference. IGCL ships under
       the Intel Software License Agreement, which permits use "solely for use
       on Intel platforms", imposes broad indemnification, and adds its own
       termination trigger — each a further restriction on downstream
       recipients that GPL-3.0 §10 forbids and §7 does not permit.

       Re-declaring the API by hand is explicitly NOT an approved workaround:
       struct layouts must match byte for byte, so an "independent"
       implementation is indistinguishable from a copy.

       Licensing regressions are silent and hard to unwind later. That is why
       this runs at PR time rather than at release.

    2. Every vendored third-party component has a licence copy in
       legal/licenses/.

    3. Every NuGet package the App and the Agent SHIP has its licence text in
       legal/licenses/nuget/, exactly as tools/license-gather.ps1 writes it
       from this build's restore output (P4 PR-6). Until then this gate knew one
       package, LibreHardwareMonitorLib, while 77 shipped.

    Exit 0 clean, 1 on any violation.

# as noted below", and the MIT grant lives in the exception list that follows.
# So the question for any file vendored from that tree is not "what does the
# root licence say" but "is THIS PATH on the list" -- and a re-sync that adds a
# header without checking is how a file under the wrong licence arrives with the
# directory's licence copy sitting beside it looking fine. Both halves are
# asserted per file: on the list, and carrying the grant in its own banner.
#
# The list happens to cover the whole tree today (845 of 845 blobs). That is a
# fact about one commit, not a property to rely on: the check reads the list.
