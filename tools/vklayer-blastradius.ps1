.SYNOPSIS
    Measures the blast radius of the FrameLedger Vulkan implicit layer.

.DESCRIPTION
    docs/20_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md §R2 calls this the highest blast-radius item in the
    whole spike, and it is: an implicit layer is machine-wide, so a passthrough
    bug loads FrameLedger into EVERY Vulkan process on the system — including
    anything anti-cheat-protected — before a single line of our guard has run.

    §S2's fix is `enable_environment` in the manifest, so the loader does not map
    the layer at all unless the Agent sets the variable when launching a game the
    user opted in. This script measures whether the loader actually behaves that
    way, rather than trusting the manifest documentation.

    THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE THE LAYER IS REGISTERED in this phase, and it
    unregisters in a finally block — including on Ctrl-C or a failed assertion.
    A registered implicit layer is a load path into game processes that no guard
    covers yet (§S2 is still open), so leaving one behind would be the exact
    hazard this script exists to measure.

    Discriminating by construction: the "must not load" case is only meaningful
    if the "must load" case is shown to work in the same run. A loader that never
    loads the layer for an unrelated reason would otherwise look like a pass.

    #   1. With the variable unset the loader still prints

    #      the DLL name hit that PATH — the manifest sits in a directory called
    #      FrameLedger.VkLayer.
    #   2. vulkaninfo's own report LISTS the layer as available, by name, from
    #      the manifest. That is the tool describing the system, not the loader
    #      mapping anything.
    #
    # The unambiguous evidence is the loader saying it INSERTED us into a chain,
    # which it prints with the DLL path alongside:

    # become the thing that defends it, or the fact quietly stops being checked

    # that switched to existence-checking would widen the highest blast radius in
