.SYNOPSIS
    Validates rules/detection-rules.json, with extra scrutiny on the anticheat
    block that feeds the hard gate.

.DESCRIPTION
    A malformed or empty blocklist is a SAFETY bug, not a lint failure
    (docs/13_CI_CD.md §rules-publish.yml). This runs in build.ps1 check and in
    CI on every change to the rules file.

    Fail-closed is the guiding rule everywhere: if this script cannot prove the
    blocklist is well-formed and non-empty, it fails.

    Two layers, because neither alone is sufficient:

    1. JSON Schema (rules/detection-rules.schema.json), proved DISCRIMINATING by
       a canary before it is trusted — Test-Json fails open on a malformed
       schema (docs/20_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md §S5).
    2. Imperative checks a schema cannot express: required families still
       present IN THE RIGHT GROUP, no case-insensitive duplicate values, and no
       prefix short enough to shadow a system module.

# every rules file "valid", including one with an empty blocklist.

# --- Canary 2: the schema still discriminates on nameFragments (§S19(d)) -----

# The canary above is `{"schemaVersion":"not-a-number"}`, which ANY schema still

# proves nothing about the constraints that do the safety work. Delete `minItems`
# from `nameFragments` and that canary still passes, Test-Json still passes, and
# the schema half of the heuristic floor silently ceases to exist.
#
# BE PRECISE ABOUT WHAT THAT WOULD COST, because §S19(d) overstates it: the floor
# would NOT disappear. tools/gen-ac-floor.ps1 hard-errors on an empty fragment
# list and runs as a CMake custom command, so the native build fails. What is
# unguarded is the SCHEMA half — a rules file with an empty list reaching a
# machine, where the compiled-in floor is what saves it.
#
# DERIVED FROM THE SHIPPED DOCUMENT, never hand-written. A hand-written canary is
# a second statement of the schema's shape and drifts from it, which is the defect
# this whole file exists to catch. Mutating the real document means the ONLY
# difference between the passing case and the failing case is the constraint under
# test.
#
# Both directions: the unmodified document has just been asserted to pass, three
# lines above. So a failure here is specifically "the empty list was accepted".

# --- §S23-5: no `$comment` anywhere may enumerate the gate's composition -----

# The composition of the pre-injection gate is stated in
# docs/19_SAFETY_AND_ANTICHEAT.md §Pre-injection checks, ONCE. This file's
# top-level `$comment` used to restate it — a fourth copy, in the one artifact
# that ships to users — and that copy was wrong in two ways at once: it omitted
# check 2b (services), the only tier ever MEASURED firing on real anti-cheat, and
# it went stale the moment check 3's executable half was wired.
#
# §S23-4 closed the identical class by REMOVING a restatement rather than
# correcting one. This is what makes the removal stick.
#
# WALKS EVERY `$comment` IN THE DOCUMENT, and that is not thoroughness for its own
# sake — it is a bug fix. The first version of this check was scoped to
# `anticheat.$comment`, and the text it exists to catch lives in the TOP-LEVEL
# `$comment`. It could not fire. Its canary reported green twice: once because a
# backtick inside a double-quoted PowerShell needle silently mangled the search
# string so the mutation never applied, and once for real. A check scoped to the
# wrong object is this file's own signature defect, committed inside the fix for
# it. Walking every `$comment` also means moving the text does not dodge the gate.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT FORBID: mentioning a check. "tracked as §S14" and "check 3
# matches nothing" are facts about THIS DATA and belong here. What it forbids is a
# LIST — two or more check numbers in one line is a composition claim, and
# composition claims belong in exactly one document.

#   * kRulesTokenBudget bounds the WHOLE FILE, including engines/platforms/
#     capabilities the guard never reads — jsmn tokenises everything before it
#     locates `anticheat`.
#
# Both are checked here as well as in ctest fl_rules_budget, because a rules-only
# PR routes through rules-publish.yml, which never builds native. Neither cap is
# a truncation: exceeding one is ParseResult::kTooLarge for the whole file, which
# the guard turns into "refuse every title on this machine".
#
# THE THRESHOLDS ARE READ OUT OF THE HEADER, never restated. A number copied into
# this script is the third place it can drift, and drift between the schema and
# the parser is the entire defect this check exists to prevent. If the header or
# a constant cannot be read, that FAILS — a capacity check that silently stops
# checking is worse than no check, because it reads as coverage.
