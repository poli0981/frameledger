.SYNOPSIS
    Asserts every shipped native binary carries a populated VERSIONINFO block.

.DESCRIPTION
    docs/19_SAFETY_AND_ANTICHEAT.md §What we will never build: the DLL ships
    with its real filename, real exports, and a populated version block. An
    anti-cheat vendor looking at a module inside their game must be able to tell
    instantly what it is and who wrote it. Being identifiable is the design
    principle, not a side effect — anything that made these fields vaguer,
    absent or randomised would be evasion, which CLAUDE.md rule 3 rejects.

    src/native/FrameLedger.Overlay/CMakeLists.txt carried the comment
    "VERSIONINFO is mandatory and CI fails the build without it" directly above
    a TODO to add it, while no .rc file existed anywhere and nothing checked.
    This script is what makes that sentence true.

    Reads the BUILT BINARY rather than the .rc source: what ships is what
    matters, and a resource that fails to compile in would leave the source
    looking correct.
