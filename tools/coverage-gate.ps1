.SYNOPSIS
    Enforces the coverage thresholds docs/14_TESTING.md states as PR-failing.

.DESCRIPTION
    `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"` has been producing
    coverage.cobertura.xml since the repository was scaffolded and NOTHING HAS
    EVER READ IT. 14_TESTING says ">= 80% on Domain + Application" and "Domain
    metric calculators >= 95% or the PR fails"; neither was enforced anywhere.

    THE GATE IS SELF-ARMING. When it was written Domain and Application were
    empty (guard logic went to C++ under 20_OPEN_QUESTIONS §S13(a)), so there was
    nothing to measure and a threshold would have been decorative. Rather than
    skip - a skipped gate reads as a passed one, which is the defect shape this
    project keeps finding - the script checks whether the project has any .cs
    file. No source => report the emptiness explicitly and pass. First .cs file
    => the threshold applies immediately, with no second commit to remember.
    It armed on 2026-09-09 (P2 PR-A: Domain.Metrics; PR-C: Application.Capture)
    and has been biting since; this paragraph said "empty today" for four days
    after that, corrected 2026-09-13 rather than rewritten as if it never had.

    That ordering matters: adding a threshold AFTER the code exists is how the
    number gets negotiated down to whatever the code already scores.

.PARAMETER MinLineRate
    Assembly floor from 14_TESTING (0.80).

.PARAMETER MinCalculatorLineRate
    Floor for Domain metric calculators (0.95).

#
# UNION THE LINES, do not pick a report. The previous code maximised the rate and
# the line count INDEPENDENTLY, so it could pair 100%-of-5-lines from one report
# with 500-lines from another and report a figure no run produced — and the
# empty-assembly defence below is exactly what that recombination defeats.
#
# Picking the single report with the most lines is no better: with equal line
# counts the choice is arbitrary, and it throws away real coverage, because a
# line exercised only by Application.Tests is still exercised. Measured: that
# approach reported 68.7% for an assembly whose union is higher.
#
# So merge at LINE level — a line is covered if any report saw it hit — and
# derive the rate from the merged set. The pair is then self-consistent by
# construction rather than by a rule about which report to trust.
