.SYNOPSIS
    Asserts that no code path can inject except through the anti-cheat guard's own file.

.DESCRIPTION
    AMENDED 2026-09-21. This header said "no code path can inject without PASSING the
    guard", and since the owner's decision of that day that is no longer the claim: the
    guard has one acknowledged entry (FlGuardedInjectAcknowledged, 19_SAFETY "The user's
    bypass") that injects where the evaluation refused on the guard's own judgement. What
    this script asserts is unchanged and is what makes that entry safe to have: the
    primitive still lives in ONE file, so the acknowledged path is the guard's own code -
    it still runs every check, still reports what it found, still verifies the payload -
    and the evasion primitives still appear NOWHERE. A bypass that lived outside this
    file, or that changed HOW the injection happens, is exactly what these checks refuse.

    CLAUDE.md rule 2 (as first written): "The anti-cheat guard is a hard gate, not a
    warning... There is no override switch." docs/14_TESTING.md calls for a test that
    asserts no code path reaches the injection primitive without a passing
    guard result, and 20_OPEN_QUESTIONS §S8 records that the mechanism
    originally proposed for it — a `sealed` token type only the guard can
    produce — does not work: a token that escapes can simply be IGNORED, because
    a caller can decline to ask for one.

    §S13(b) settled on the stronger shape: the guard OWNS THE CHOKEPOINT. The
    injection primitive has internal linkage inside fl_guard.cpp, so no other
    translation unit has a symbol to call. This script is what keeps that true.

    Two checks, because the first alone is easy to route around:

      1. The primitive's name appears in exactly one file.
      2. The Win32 calls that CONSTITUTE injection — VirtualAllocEx,
         WriteProcessMemory, CreateRemoteThread, and the manual-mapping and
         evasion primitives 19_SAFETY forbids outright — appear nowhere in the
         native tree except that same file.

    Check 2 is the one that matters. Somebody writing a second injector
    elsewhere would never touch the first name, and a reviewer scanning a large
    diff would not necessarily notice.
