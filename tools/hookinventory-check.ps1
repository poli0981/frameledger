.SYNOPSIS
    Every vendor symbol FrameLedger.Overlay resolves by name must exist, in the
    module the Overlay takes it from, in measured data.

.DESCRIPTION
    docs/17_HOOK_ENGINE.md calls a wrong symbol name degrading silently to
    `unknown` "the highest false-confidence risk in the spike". The failure has
    no symptom: a misspelt name resolves to nothing, the Overlay installs
    nothing, and the record it writes is byte-identical to an honest writer's on
    a title with no upscaler. Green everywhere, and wrong.

    THIS IS PREVENTION, AND IT FIXED NOTHING. No drift exists today — every
    symbol in the inventory was resolved against all 34 measured modules before
    this script was written. Saying so matters: a gate whose write-up implies it
    caught something is a gate whose value nobody can audit later.

    WHAT THE ORACLE IS. docs/vendor-exports.json, produced by
    tools/vendor-exports.ps1 running dumpbin over DLLs installed titles actually
    ship. It is MEASURED DATA from one machine, never a vendor SDK and never a
    transcription, which is the whole reason it can be trusted as an oracle here.

    THE LOOKUP IS MODULE-SCOPED, and that is not a detail. Asking "does anything
    export this name" would pass a hook that takes NVSDK_NGX_D3D12_EvaluateFeature
    from any of the SEVEN modules exporting it, and 03_METRICS derives F_app by
    SUBTRACTING that count — so a double-counted evaluation lands on fg_factor,
    the number CLAUDE.md rule 6 exists to protect.

    FOUR PASSES (three independent ones, and a fourth for the census table --
    added 2026-09-03), because each has a blind spot the next covers.
    Pass A checks the inventory rows against the oracle. Pass B sweeps the
    Overlay's own sources for vendor-shaped string literals that are NOT in the
    inventory — a second resolver written somewhere else would otherwise be
    invisible to this gate while being exactly what it exists to prevent. Same
    argument tools/chokepoint-check.ps1 makes about FL_GUARD_TESTABLE.

    PASS C READS THE BUILT BINARY, and it is the only one that can catch the
    failure that matters most. A and B are source checks: they see what we
    RESOLVE. Neither sees what we LINK. Taking the address of an SL_API
    declaration in evaluated code — `&slEvaluateFeature` instead of the runtime
    resolution — makes sl.interposer.dll a LOAD-TIME dependency of
    FrameLedger.Overlay.dll, and the Overlay then fails to load in every game
    that ships no Streamline: inside the loader, before DllMain, with no message
    anywhere and nothing in the ring to explain it. The vendored headers are
    included for types only for exactly this reason
    (src/native/third_party/streamline/README.md).

    PASS C READS THE EXPORT TABLE TOO, since 2026-09-04. The vendored ffx_api.h
    declares its entry points __declspec(dllexport) unconditionally; a definition
    of one inside the Overlay would announce a vendor API we do not implement,
    with every import check green. Same failure class, other table.

    THAT README ASSERTED THIS CHECK EXISTED AND IT DID NOT. Recorded because it
    is the shape this repository keeps finding: a document describing a gate,
    reviewers trusting the document, and nothing behind it. Added 2026-08-14
    after a plan-time audit went looking for the code and found one mention of
    `dumpbin`, in a comment, about a different script.

.PARAMETER RepoRoot
    Repository root. Defaults to this script's parent directory.

.PARAMETER BuildDir
    Native build output, for Pass C. Defaults to build/native/x64-release.

.PARAMETER RequireBinaries
    Makes Pass C mandatory. Without it a missing FrameLedger.Overlay.dll is
    reported and skipped, because `build.ps1 -SkipNative` legitimately produces
    no binary; with it, a missing or unreadable binary is a FAILURE. build.ps1
    passes it whenever the native build ran, following chokepoint-check.

.PARAMETER SelfTest
    Runs the decision table in BOTH directions and exits non-zero if any case
    comes out wrong, so the gate's ability to go red is proven on every build
    rather than assumed. build.ps1 runs this AND the live pass, following
    tools/changelog-check.ps1: a gate wired self-test-only never reads the
    repository, which is the defect it exists to prevent.
