.SYNOPSIS
    The accuracy blocks in README.md and legal/DISCLAIMER.md are one text, kept in
    legal/ACCURACY.md, and this gate fails when any copy has drifted from it.

.DESCRIPTION
    docs/20_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md §S23-6: the accuracy blocks were hand-maintained prose
    that nothing verified, and DISCLAIMER's went stale four times in one direction
    and once in the other. Single-sourcing them does not make them true — that is
    still a human's job, dated in the block itself — but it makes there be exactly
    one place to get them wrong, and a build that notices when a copy is not that
    place.

    Each target file embeds the block between
        <!-- accuracy-block:begin -->
        <!-- accuracy-block:end -->
    and the text between the markers must equal legal/ACCURACY.md with its own
    `<!-- … -->` comment lines removed, after line-ending normalisation and
    trimming. Missing markers fail; a second pair of markers fails; whitespace-only
    drift is tolerated because CRLF/LF and a trailing newline are not what this
    gate is for.

    -SelfTest proves the gate discriminates, both directions, on temporary copies:
    the shipped files pass, a one-character mutation inside a block fails, and a
    file with its markers removed fails. A gate that has never been red is a gate
    nobody has seen work.
