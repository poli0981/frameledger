# Changelog

All notable changes to FrameLedger are documented here.

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) — `MAJOR`
bumps for a database schema or IPC protocol break (`docs/11_UPDATER.md`).

`release.yml` reads the section for the tag being released (`tools/release-notes.ps1`) and
uses it as the GitHub release body. A missing or empty `## [x.y.z]` section is a **red
release**, not an empty note — so cutting a release means moving the `[Unreleased]` entries
under a `## [x.y.z] - date` heading in the same commit that bumps `VERSION`, then tagging
(`docs/13_CI_CD.md` §Branch & release policy). *(For a pre-release, `vX.Y.Z-beta.N`, `VERSION` already holds the
numeric core and does not move; the heading is the full version — corrected 2026-10-04.)*

> **Built 2026-09-14 (P4 PR-5).** From 2026-08-06 until then this paragraph said the workflow
> "will" exist and that a missing section "will mean an empty release note"; the second half
> was the wrong design and is replaced rather than implemented. ~~This file still has no
> `## [x.y.z]` heading: the first one is the owner's, in the commit that cuts the first tag.~~
>
> **The first heading is `## [0.1.0-beta.1]` (2026-09-16), and it is a summary rather than the moved
> entries.** The instruction above says "move the `[Unreleased]` entries under the heading"; by the first
> tag those entries were 370 KB — every PR since 2026-08-04 — and a GitHub release body holds 125,000
> characters. So the versioned section is a written summary of what the pre-release is and is not, and
> the entries it summarises stay below it, verbatim, under a heading that is not a version
> (`## Ledger before 0.1.0-beta.1`), where `release-notes.ps1` stops reading. From the second tag on,
> the entries under `[Unreleased]` are short enough to move as written.

> **Split 2026-10-19 (beta.24, owner decision D66).** Each released section now lives in its own file under
> `docs/changelog/`, moved verbatim, and the ledger kept before the first tag in five parts under
> `docs/changelog/ledger-before-0.1.0-beta.1/`; the table below lists them all. This file keeps `[Unreleased]`, where
> every pull request adds its entry (`tools/changelog-check.ps1` looks for this file). `tools/release-notes.ps1` reads
> `docs/changelog/<version>.md` for the tag being released, so cutting a release moves the `[Unreleased]` entries into
> that new file — under its `## [x.y.z] - date` heading — and adds its row to the table, in the commit that is tagged.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **A frame-generation "state" of ×2.52.** The owner's Silent Hill 2 session under the NVIDIA App's *Dynamic* multi
  frame generation listed ×2.52 for 13 seconds beside ×2.0 and ×3.0: the five-second windows in which the multiplier
  stepped from ×2 to ×3 read in between, and three of them formed a state nobody held. Every frame generation that
  ships multiplies by a whole number, so a window now counts toward a state only within 10 % of one; the others are
  *Not classified*. Sessions already recorded are read by the same rule: that session lists ×2.0, ×3.0, no frame
  generation and 7.36 % not classified. The owner's runs of 2026-10-20 are recorded in
  `docs/spike-notes/23-owner-runs-2026-10-20.md`.
- **The NVIDIA driver's DLSS report was lost from every stored session.** FrameLedger asked the driver one last time
  after the game had closed, and that answer — which no longer says DLSS ran — replaced the ones read while the game
  ran. So no session said *DLSS (driver-reported)* where no hook saw DLSS, and none named the NVIDIA App's quality mode
  on such a game: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 under the App's override read *Upscaler not identified*. The driver is no
  longer asked once the game has closed, and once it reports that DLSS ran, the session keeps it. Sessions recorded
  before keep what they stored.
- **Play ▸ *Start directly* recorded nothing of a game that hands itself to Steam.** Lies of P, started directly, closes
  within seconds and Steam starts it again; the game Steam started was turned away while the first session ended and
  never recorded. It is now recorded once that session ends, as a game started again already was. Each such start
  still counts toward the two early exits that turn hooking off for a game, so Limitations ▸ Play advises starting such
  a game through its store.
- **Opening a session's summary twice opened two windows.** The open window comes forward instead, restored if
  minimised.
- **No window or monitor size for a game in exclusive full-screen.** A game leaving exclusive full-screen closes its
  window a moment before its swap chain says so, and those last samples replaced the sizes: two Lies of P and three
  Dark Souls III sessions show none. The sizes are now the last ones the mode saw.
- **A DLSS line that said only "DLSS"**, under a header that already did, is no longer shown: the NVIDIA App's override
  loads its libraries under names FrameLedger does not list (The Witcher 3), and the *Loaded:* line prints them.
- **Two integration tests that failed under load** (developers only). The guard reads every process above the test
  harness too, the test host among them, and under a full `build.ps1 check` the test host is still starting its other
  test classes: a module it released while the guard read its list refused the injection (`ModuleScanFailed`, and
  `ProcessUnreadable` on 2026-10-19). The drain suite asks the guard again on those two reasons, four times at most;
  the pause case, which once read the writer still starting, waits for it to be ready; and every injection test waits
  for the harness's own "presenting" line instead of 800 ms (`tests/Shared/HarnessReady.cs`).
