// Internal linkage, in the guard's own translation unit, deliberately. This is
// the mechanism 20_OPEN_QUESTIONS §S8/§S13(b) settled on after the documented
// one was disproved: a "clearance token only the guard can produce" can be
// IGNORED — a caller simply never asks for one — whereas a function with no
// external symbol cannot be called at all.
//
// It is not declared in any header. tools/chokepoint-check.ps1 fails the build
// if the name appears in any source file other than this one.
//
// Injection uses documented LoadLibraryW. No manual mapping, no PE header
// erasure, no PEB unlinking, no thread hiding — CLAUDE.md rule 3, and
// 19_SAFETY §What we will never build.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// VirtualAllocEx + WriteProcessMemory + CreateRemoteThread on LoadLibraryW.
//
// The most ordinary injection technique there is, and that is the point.
// 19_SAFETY §What we will never build rules out manual mapping, PE header
// erasure, PEB unlinking, thread hiding and every other way of being harder to
// see. A performance tool should be EASY for anti-cheat to identify: the DLL
// keeps its real name, its real exports and a populated VERSIONINFO block, and
// it arrives through the documented loader like RTSS, OBS and ReShade do.
//
// Reached only from GuardedInject, below, after every check has passed.
//
// Returns kAllow on success, or WHY it did not happen. It used to return bool,
// and the caller turned false into an Allow verdict carrying a free-text signal
// — so a failed injection was indistinguishable from a successful one at the

// Check 3 — the per-title blocklist, EXECUTABLE HALF.
//
// 19_SAFETY has listed this as check 3 since the beginning and it had NO CALL
// SITE: MatchesBlockedExecutable was implemented, tested, and asked by nobody, so
// populating the data would have changed nothing (§S14). "Check 3 passed" read as
// "this title is not a known online title" while nothing had looked.
//
// UNRESOLVABLE IDENTITY REFUSES. §S14's second decision, and 19_SAFETY says an
// unresolvable identity "must read UNKNOWN, never clean". A pid whose image we
// cannot name is a pid whose identity we do not have, so kFailed and kIncomplete
// both refuse with kProcessUnreadable -- the same reason CheckModules already
// uses for the same underlying inability.
//
// THE STORE-ID HALF IS NOT HERE, and that is a limitation rather than an
// omission. MatchesBlockedStoreId exists and is tested; it cannot be called,
// for three independent reasons (§S14):
//
//   1. NO PRODUCER. Nothing in the tree parses Steam .acf, GOG .info or Epic
//      .item -- the platform metadata extractors were never built, so `store_id`
//      is null for every title.
//   2. NO CHANNEL, BY DESIGN. FlGuardEvaluate takes a pid and nothing else, and
//      fl_guard_abi.h says so deliberately: "no way to hand in evidence -- the
//      guard collects its own". A store id passed in by the caller is a caller
//      asserting a safety fact, which §S3's rule forbids in as many words.
//   3. APPLYING "unknown refuses" TO IT WOULD BE A GATE THAT CANNOT PASS. If the
//      guard can never resolve a store id and an unresolved store id refuses,
//      every title on every machine refuses.
//
// So the exe-name half runs and the store-id half is named as blocked. Do not
// "fix" (2) by widening the ABI.
