// The C ABI the managed Agent reaches the guard through.
//
// 20_OPEN_QUESTIONS §S15 item 1: `04_CAPTURE` writes `AntiCheatGuard.Check(pid)`
// and `01_ARCHITECTURE` draws the guard inside the Agent box, while §S13(a) put
// the authoritative guard in C++. Those descriptions are reconciled by making
// the managed side a FACADE — one implementation, reached through this ABI —
// and never a second matcher. Two blocklist matchers that can disagree is a
// fail-open by construction: the day they diverge, one of them is wrong and
// nothing tells you which.
//
// WHY THIS IS A DLL EXPORT AND §S9's INJECTOR EXE STILL IS NOT.
//
// §S9 refused to ship a user-runnable injector because it was a path into a
// game process THAT THE GUARD DID NOT STAND IN FRONT OF. This is the opposite:
// there is no entry point here that skips a check. `FlGuardedInject` runs the
// full guard — module scan across the §S16 scan set, driver scan, service
// scan, rules completeness — and returns a refusal if any of it fails. A caller
// can ask; only the guard answers.
//
// What this ABI deliberately does NOT carry: per-game consent. That lives in
// the Agent's database (`games.hook_consent_at`), because it is a record of
// something a human did, and CLAUDE.md rule 1 makes it the Agent's
// responsibility to check before asking. This ABI enforces the ANTI-CHEAT gate
// — the part that protects accounts — not the opt-in.

//
// WHY THE GUARD CARRIES IT AND NOT THE OVERLAY. 07_IPC makes a buildId mismatch
// in the shm handshake a hard refuse-to-attach, and 04_CAPTURE says the Agent
// compares it "against its own". The Agent had NO OWN VALUE: FL_BUILD_ID is a
// CMake compile definition visible only to native targets, and `grep -rni
// buildid` over src/**/*.cs returned zero (20_OPEN_QUESTIONS §S23-1). So the
// comparison could not run in either direction — half a mechanism that reads as
// a whole one.
//
// The Overlay exports FlGetBuildId(), but the Agent cannot call it: reaching that
// export means LoadLibraryW on FrameLedger.Overlay.dll, which starts its init
// thread and creates a ring under the AGENT's pid. The payload is not something
// its own host may load.
//
// The guard is already loaded by the Agent, by absolute path from our install
// directory (§S22). The comparison the Agent actually needs is "does the DLL
// inside that game match the install I am running", which is exactly what this
// answers.
//
// It rests on guard and Overlay carrying the SAME id, and that holds by
// construction rather than by test: FL_BUILD_ID is one INTERFACE compile
// definition on FrameLedger.Shm, set once per CMake configure, and both targets
// link it. No test asserts it because fl_guard_abi.cpp is not compiled into
// fl_guard_test — said here rather than left for a reader to assume measured.

// Would the GUARD accept this rules document? Returns fl::guard::ParseResult.
//
// §S20 needs it because the managed side structurally cannot answer the
// question. `DetectionRulesFile` reads engines/platforms/capabilities and states
// at DetectionRulesDto that there is no `anticheat` member "and there never will
// be" (§S15 — no second matcher). So validating a candidate rules file with it
// checks everything except the half the hard gate consumes, and would let a
// seeder install a document the guard then refuses for every title while
// reporting success.
//
// Buffer in, enum out. NO PATH PARAMETER — the rules source is not selectable
// (§S3, §S21), and this must not become the way it becomes selectable. It parses
// a candidate the caller already holds; it does not read, choose or install
// anything.
//
// Not a second matcher: it calls fl::guard::ParseRules, the same function the
// gate parses with. That is the whole point — the thing that validates and the
// thing that parses are one.
//
// NOT re-entrant, like every other guard entry point: ParseRules uses a
// function-scope static token array. Callers are expected to be the Agent at
// startup, before any capture is running (docs/07_IPC §guardTicks describes the
