// The anti-cheat guard — the hard gate (docs/19_SAFETY_AND_ANTICHEAT.md).
//
// This is the one component where a bug can cost somebody their account
// (docs/14_TESTING.md §Safety-guard tests), and the whole file is shaped by
// three rules that are not negotiable:
//
//   1. EVERY uncertainty is a REFUSAL. "I could not look" and "I looked and it
//      was clean" must never produce the same value. The project has already
//      shipped one defect of exactly that shape — EnumDeviceDrivers returning
//      258 drivers and zero usable names to a standard user, which a guard
//      would have read as "no anti-cheat present" on a machine running
//      Vanguard (docs/spike-notes.md §1).
//   2. NO CLEARANCE ESCAPES. The guard owns the chokepoint: it collects
//      evidence, matches, and calls the injection primitive itself. A token
//      handed to a caller can be ignored — the caller can simply not ask for
//      one. A symbol that does not exist cannot be called (§S8, §S13(b)).
//   3. EVERY INPUT IS A SEAM. Module enumeration, driver enumeration, service
//      queries, the process tree and the rules file all arrive through
//      function pointers, so the Catch2 suite can force each failure the
//      matrix in 14_TESTING requires. An input that cannot be made to fail in
//      a test is an input whose failure path is unverified.
//
// There is deliberately no "check and tell me the answer" public entry point.
// See FlGuardedInject at the bottom.

    // Grouping is worth less than a number that never moves.
    kPreScanFailed,

    // The guard PASSED and the injection still did not happen.
    //
    // These exist because the previous code returned kAllow with the truth in a
    // free-text signal, above a comment claiming "the caller distinguishes them
    // by reason" — and there was no reason to distinguish by. A caller reading
    // Allowed() got `true` for an injection that never occurred. Measured
    // 2026-08-03 against a real 32-bit title.
    //
    // Allowed() is now false for both: it means "the DLL is loaded in the

    // says whose fault it was, because the responses differ — a refusal is
    // permanent, a failed injection may be worth retrying, and WOW64 is
    // permanent but for an entirely different reason.
    kInjectionFailed,

    // The target is a 32-bit process. Permanent and expected, not an error:
    // the Overlay is x64-only, so an x64 DLL cannot load there
    // (20_OPEN_QUESTIONS §Scope decisions). The UI should say so and offer
    // Tier 2 rather than reporting a failure the user could act on. (Tier 2
    // measures nothing since 2026-08-28; it is the honest record of a capture
    // that did not happen, not a lesser one.)
    kTargetIsWow64,

    // The PAYLOAD is not ours (§S22).
    //
    // Every other reason in this enum is about the TARGET or about the machine.
    // This one is about the DLL we were asked to load, and it exists because the
    // gate had a hole exactly that shape: FlGuardedInject takes a caller-supplied
    // path and, until this reason existed, the only thing asked of it was
    // GetFileAttributesW — "exists and is not a directory". A caller could hand
    // the shipped, exported guard any DLL on the machine and have it loaded into
    // any x64 process that happened to carry no anti-cheat.
    //
    // Refusing here is not a failed injection: nothing was attempted. It is the
    // guard declining, which is why it is a Reason and not a kInjectionFailed
    // variant — a mislabelled reason is a wrong answer for whoever has to fix it.
    kPayloadNotOurs,

    // Refusals the CAPTURE GATE makes, which this guard structurally cannot.
    //
    // Consent and per-game enablement are records of something a human did;
    // they live in the Agent's database and the native guard never sees them.
    // They are nevertheless reasons a Tier-1 capture was refused, and they
    // belong in THIS enum for the reason FlStaticPreScan already reports
    // through FlGuardResult: one reason table, one mirror surface, one place
    // the UI maps to a string.
    //
    // Before these existed the managed gate returned kBlockedExecutable for all
    // three — check 3's code, which at the time the native guard could not
    // produce at all (§S14: the matchers had no call site; #52 gave the
    // executable half one, so the native guard DOES produce it now, which makes
    // keeping these three distinct more important rather than less: a logged
    // kBlockedExecutable is now a real check-3 hit and must not be ambiguous
    // with a consent failure). So the UI would have told a user
    // "this title is on the per-title blocklist" when the truth was "you have
    // not accepted the consent dialog", and a logged kBlockedExecutable meant
    // one of four unrelated things.
    //
    // The guard itself never returns these. That is not a defect: the enum is
    // the vocabulary of the whole gate path, and it already carries
    // kInjectionFailed and kTargetIsWow64, which are not blocklist matches
    // either.
