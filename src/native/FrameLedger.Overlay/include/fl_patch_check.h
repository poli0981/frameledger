// Compare-and-restore for INLINE patches (17_HOOK_ENGINE §Unhooking, §H7).
//
// The Overlay's hooks are MinHook inline patches on the first bytes of a
// function, not vtable-entry swaps, and the H7 hazard exists for them in the same
// shape: if another overlay patched the same prologue AFTER us, it saved OUR
// jump as its "original" and chains through it. MH_DisableHook writes our saved
// prologue back unconditionally -- which would remove THEIR hook silently, with
// no error anywhere, and we would have caused it. So before disabling a patch,
// the Overlay asks whether the bytes at the target are still the jump MinHook
// wrote for us; if not, the patch is left alone and our detour stays in their
// chain doing nothing (g_observing is 0, every body forwards).
//
// What MinHook writes on x64 (hook.c EnableHookLL / CreateHook):
//   target:      E9 rel32              -> relay
//   relay:       FF 25 00 00 00 00     JMP [RIP+0]
//                <8-byte absolute>     = our detour
// and, when the function has a hot-patch area (patchAbove):
//   target-5:    E9 rel32              -> relay
//   target:      EB F9                 JMP -7 (back to target-5)
// A foreign overlay that patches over us replaces the E9's rel32 (or the whole
// prologue) so the chain no longer ends at our detour -- which is exactly what
// this reads. Reads only; the relay address comes from bytes somebody else may
// have written, so the reads are SEH-guarded and a fault reads as "not ours".
//
// Header-only and MinHook-free so ctest fl_unhook_inline can drive it against a
// real MinHook patch and a simulated foreign one without loading the Overlay.
