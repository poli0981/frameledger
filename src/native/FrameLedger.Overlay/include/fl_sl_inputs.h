// Walking the chained structures a title passes to slEvaluateFeature.
//
// WHY THIS IS A HEADER AND NOT A STATIC FUNCTION IN dllmain.cpp. Everything here
// dereferences pointers supplied by somebody else's process, under bounds we
// chose. That is exactly the code that has to be exercised against malformed
// input -- a cycle, a lying count, a null element -- and a function buried in an
// anonymous namespace inside the injected DLL can only be reached by injecting
// it. Here, hook-harness calls it directly and drives the hostile cases in
// microseconds (ctest fl_sl_inputs).
//
// RULE 4, AND WHY THIS IS INSIDE IT. `inputs` is an ARGUMENT to an API we
// hooked, which CLAUDE.md rule 4 permits in as many words. sl_core_api.h:251
// documents it as "the chained structures providing the input data (viewport,
// tags, constants etc)". We read the vendor's own declared layout and nothing
// else: no pattern scanning, no game state, no memory we were not handed.
//
// RULE 5, AND WHAT THAT COSTS. A fault in here lands in FL_HOOK_GUARD and burns
// one of the three that self-disable the Overlay. A hostile input that faults is
// therefore a BUG, not acceptable degradation, which is why every bound below is
// a constant and every dereference is preceded by a null check.
