// The arithmetic behind dispatchRaysVolume, in a header so it can be checked
// without a hook.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT IN dllmain.cpp. Every branch here is reached by multiplying three
// numbers a CALLER filled in, and the failure mode is silent: a wrapped product is
// a small number that reads like a measurement. fl_sl_seen.h is the precedent --
// the word RecordPresent drains has its field algebra as static_asserts in a
// header, checked in every translation unit that includes it, and its BEHAVIOUR in
// `ctest fl_sl_seen`. Same split here: the identities below cannot be forgotten by
// a test, and hook-harness --probe-dxr-inputs drives the shapes a game could send.
//
// WHY SATURATION GOES HIGH. dispatchRaysVolume is the NUMERATOR of 03_METRICS'
// rays_per_pixel, so a wrapped value under-reports the one input the path-tracing
// heuristic actually reads -- and it does so most on exactly the titles the
// heuristic exists to recognise, since those dispatch the most rays. Saturating at
// UINT32_MAX makes the failure visible and one-directional; a consumer seeing the
// ceiling must refuse to publish rays_per_pixel rather than divide by a floor.
// This is the mirror of fgEvaluations' 255, which saturates for the opposite
// reason: that one is a DENOMINATOR, and a wrap there inflates without bound.

// UINT32s multiply to at most (2^32-1)^2 = 2^64 - 2^33 + 1, which FITS in a
