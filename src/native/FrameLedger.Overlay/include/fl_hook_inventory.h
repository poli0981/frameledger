// The vendor symbols FrameLedger.Overlay resolves by name, and the module each
// one must come from.
//
// ONE TABLE, THREE CONSUMERS, and that is the whole point of the file:
//
//   1. dllmain.cpp installs from it.
//   2. tools/hookinventory-check.ps1 parses it and asserts every row appears in
//      docs/vendor-exports.json -- measured data, so a symbol name that exists
//      only in somebody's memory fails the build.
//   3. tools/vendor-stubs generates its exported names from it, so the fixture
//      exercises the SHIPPED names rather than a second copy of them.
//
// That third consumer is the §S29(b) lesson applied before it can bite again:
// `ctest fl_vtable_indices` once proved a fact about dxgi.dll instead of a fact
// about FrameLedger.Overlay, because the harness declared its own copy of the
// slot numbers. A stub DLL exporting its own hand-typed spelling of
// "slEvaluateFeature" would be exactly that defect wearing a vendor's name --
// the test would pass while the Overlay looked for something else.
//
// WHY MODULE SCOPE IS A COLUMN AND NOT A COMMENT. Resolving a vendor symbol by
// name alone is not "slightly imprecise", it is wrong by a factor of seven.
// Measured from docs/vendor-exports.json on the dev machine:
//
//   NVSDK_NGX_D3D12_EvaluateFeature -> SEVEN modules  (nvngx_dlss, nvngx_dlssd,
//       nvngx_dlssg, nvngx_deepdvc, sl.common, _nvngx, nvngx)
//   slEvaluateFeature               -> ONE module     (sl.interposer)
//
// A name-resolved hook that catches the first match, or worse every match,
// counts one logical evaluation several times. That number is `fgEvaluations`,
// and 03_METRICS computes F_app = sum(fgEvaluations) with
// fg_factor = presents / F_app -- so an inflated count INFLATES Native FPS and
// DEFLATES fg_factor, reporting a title as generating fewer frames than it does.
// Either direction is the same class of defect: a number arrived at by arithmetic
// rather than by measurement, which is what CLAUDE.md rule 6 exists to forbid.
// (The polarity here is the 2026-08-14 owner ruling; this comment described the
// pre-ruling subtraction until the producer landed.) (docs/HANDOFF.md says four modules and names
// `NVSDK_NGX_EvaluateFeature`, which no measured module exports at all. Both are
// corrected there in the PR that adds this file.)
//
// The Streamline tier has no such ambiguity, and that is a reason to start here
// rather than a lucky accident: one exporter, so scoping is free to hold.

// a plausible mistake here, `| FL_HOOK_RT_PSO` copied from item 4's rows landing
// next, would compile, parse, install, and publish an RT hook family that does not
// exist: `EntitledBy` would then grant FlMeasured.Rt and `IsHonest` would stop

// Streamline 2.x. The application-frame count moved to its own row,
// slGetNewFrameToken, which every Streamline 2 title calls once per frame BY

// effect DLL only through the effect DLL's own export -- and hooking both would
// count every dispatch twice. The UE5 half of that held: Hell Is Us and Expedition
// 33 ship the two effect DLLs with NO loader (the engine plugin compiles the MIT
// loader source in) and their dispatches arrive at the leaves' exports, 1x. The
// loader half did not: Dying Light: The Beast at FSR + FSR frame generation, Kingdom
// Come: Deliverance II at FSR and Black Myth: Wukong at FSR each produced ZERO
// dispatches at any leaf export while the leaves sat in the census -- the game
// calls the LOADER's export, and however the signed loader reaches its providers
// afterwards (the MIT source shows an "external provider" object, not an export
// call), it is not through the leaves' ffxDispatch. So the loader IS the game's
// entry on a loader-shipping title, and it is a row. The two counts the consumer
// prints against each other (frames/upscale-drained) and the K = 1 control in the
// fixtures are what would show a loader that re-entered a leaf's export: 2x on both.
//
// The effect-DLL split is NOT a guess about the vendor's internals: the FidelityFX
// SDK's own getting-started text says the loader "only manages the loading of
// effect type DLLs" and is "interface- and behavior-compatible with
// amd_fidelityfx_dx12.dll". The monolith IS its own leaf -- SDK 1.1.x compiled the

// ships sl.interposer.dll 1.5.6 -- a different API generation. It exports
// slInit, slEvaluateFeature, slSetTag and slShutdown, so a name check passes;
// it also exports slGetHooks, slIsFeatureEnabled and slSetFeatureConstants,
// which SL2 does not have, and it does NOT export the three below.
//
// THE NAMES SURVIVED THE VERSION BUMP AND THE SIGNATURES DID NOT, which is the
// whole hazard. docs/vendor-exports.json records ONE COPY PER MODULE NAME, so
// hookinventory-check Pass A resolves `slEvaluateFeature` against one machine's
// 2.7.4 and says nothing about the 1.5.6 a title ships. A detour typed with
// PFun_slEvaluateFeature -- SL2's (Feature, const FrameToken&,
// const BaseStructure**, uint32_t, CommandBuffer*) -- would then be called with
// SL1's argument list. Reading argument 1 as a feature id when it is not one
// yields a WRONG UPSCALER NAME, not a crash, which is the failure class
// 17_HOOK_ENGINE calls the highest false-confidence risk in the spike.
//
// So we refuse the module rather than hook it, and the record then says nothing
// about the upscaler -- which is true. FL_UPSCALER_NOT_REPORTED, not a guess.
//
// WHY THESE THREE NAMES ARE NOT INVENTORY ROWS. A row is a symbol we DETOUR;
// these are symbols we probe for existence and never call, so they carry no
// signature risk of their own. They live in this header because it is the file
// that owns which vendor names the Overlay speaks -- and because
