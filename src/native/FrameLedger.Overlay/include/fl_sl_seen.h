// The one word `RecordPresent` drains to learn what Streamline did since the last
// present -- WHICH features ran, and HOW MANY times frame generation ran.
//
// WHY A COUNT AND NOT A SECOND BIT. `03_METRICS` needs `fgEvaluations`, and a bit
// collapses two evaluations between two presents into one. Under multi-frame
// generation that is the common case rather than the edge: measured on Cyberpunk
// 2077, 10,169 presents carried only 2,461 Streamline batches, so a bit would have
// reported one evaluation where four presents had gone out.
//
// WHY ONE WORD AND NOT TWO. `RecordPresent` consumes with a single
// `exchange(0)` (dllmain.cpp), so everything it needs must arrive atomically
// together. Two atomics could be read with the features from one frame beside the
// count from another -- and the count is the denominator of `fg_factor`, which is
// the number CLAUDE.md rule 6 exists to protect.
//
// WHY A HEADER AND NOT A STATIC IN dllmain.cpp, which is the same argument
// fl_sl_inputs.h makes beside it: `hook-harness` calls these directly and drives
// saturation and the field boundaries in microseconds (ctest `fl_sl_seen`). A
// helper buried in the injected DLL's anonymous namespace can only be reached by
// injecting it.
//
// NO ATOMIC IN HERE, deliberately. This file owns the ENCODING; dllmain.cpp owns
// the `std::atomic<uint32_t>` and the memory orders. Keeping them apart is what
// lets the encoding be tested without a hook, a process, or a game.
