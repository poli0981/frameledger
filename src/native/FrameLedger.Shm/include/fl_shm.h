// below are what enforce it. Mirrored in C# by FrameLedger.Shared's
// ShmLayout.cs, and ShmLayoutMirrorTests compares both sides against the
// offsets emitted by tools/fl-layout-dump (CLAUDE.md §Struct mirroring).
//
// That sentence was present tense and FALSE from the day this file was written
// until 2026-08-05 -- there was no mirror and no test. It is true now, and the
// reason it is worth a note is where the false claim sat: in the normative
// header, where a reader is most entitled to trust it. build.ps1:324-329
// enumerates the other eight sites.
//
// SO: A FIELD CHANGED HERE MUST BE CHANGED IN ShmLayout.cs, and the build tells
// you. Add it to tools/fl-layout-dump too -- the test walks the dump's field
// list in BOTH directions, so a field this header gains and the dump does not
// report is a field the mirror silently stops checking.
//
// Header-only by design: the Overlay writes these structs from inside a game
// process and the Agent reads them from outside, so there must be exactly one
// definition and no link-time dependency between the two.
//
// Layout (docs/07_IPC.md §A + B):
//
//   [0x0000] FlShmHandshake  64 B  write-once by the Overlay at init
//   [0x0040] FlWriterState   64 B  Overlay-written (writeIndex every present)
//   [0x0080] FlControlBlock  64 B  Agent-written
//   [0x00C0] FlFrameRecord[capacity]
//
// The three header regions are separate cache lines on purpose. The Overlay
// writes region 2 every frame while the Agent writes region 3 every second;
// sharing a line would put a cross-process cache-line bounce on the hot path.
//
// A previous revision of the design declared a single 88-byte header while
// mapping the control block to 0x0040. In code, unhookRequested would have
// aliased faultCount — the safety stop would fire on any hook fault, and the
// Agent's heartbeat would clobber the fault counter. Hence the asserts.

// FlWriterState::slTagCensus — WHICH Streamline buffer types the title tagged, on
// WHICH route (2026-09-05, 20_OPEN_QUESTIONS §H5).
//
// WHY. The two global-tag detours (slSetTag, slSetTagForFrame) and the local walk
// through slEvaluateFeature's inputs read one tag type -- kBufferTypeScalingInputColor,
// for renderW/H -- and dropped every other tag on the floor. Streamline's DLSS-G
// programming guide §5.0 says a title running DLSS Frame Generation MUST tag the
// HUD-less colour and UI buffers every frame through exactly those calls; a title
// running super-resolution alone never tags them (they are inputs to nothing else the
// title evaluates through Streamline except Reflex 2's late warp, which generates no
// frames). So the types a title tags are a per-frame statement, from an argument of
// an API already hooked (CLAUDE.md rule 4), of WHICH Streamline feature it is
// feeding -- which is the identity `kFeatureDLSS_G` evaluations were supposed to
// give and never did on any measured title. The session word here says which types
// arrived on which route; the per-present half lands in fgMode (FL_FG_DLSS_G on a
// present that drained a HUD-less or UI tag) and the consumer combines it with the
// COUNT, which alone decides `none`.
//
// OR-only, watchdog-published from a process-local word, like runtimeCensus. Nine
// type bits per route, three routes. Took reserved[0] additively (no layout bump):
// a writer from before it is refused by the build-id handshake before any reader
// could see a 0 here, and 0 means "no tag of any type was seen".

    // N-1 generated ones, where N lives in sl::DLSSGOptions -- set out of band, by
    // the route HANDOFF §2b refused. So the value here is 0 or 1 on a DLSS-G title
    // (1 on the present that drained the batch, 0 on the presents the vendor's
    // swapchain emitted from it), and 03_METRICS computes F_app = Σ fgEvaluations
    // rather than presents − Σ. The old reading ("3 at x4") described a number no
    // in-policy hook can produce.
    //
    // SATURATES AT 255, NEVER WRAPS. It is the DENOMINATOR of fg_factor, so a
    // wrapped count reads low and inflates the factor without bound -- CLAUDE.md
    // rule 6's forbidden direction. 255 is therefore a sentinel as much as a value:
    // no configuration evaluates frame generation 255 times between two presents, so
    // a consumer seeing it must refuse to publish a factor rather than divide.

    // which the kFeatureDLSS_G count above never delivered on any measured title.
    // 0 or 1 on a frame-generating title, in the same shape as before: 1 on the

    // rather than a sacrifice: 03_METRICS exports the value as `vram_mb`,
    // 06_DATA_MODEL stores `vram_proc_avg_mb`, 17_HOOK_ENGINE refreshes it at 1 Hz

    // was unit-mismatched at the point of use.

    // What it does NOT buy is a future field without a layout bump — recordSize
    // and layoutVersion are compared before a reader looks at anything, so an old
    // reader refuses a new writer and never reaches an unknown field. What it buys
    // is that existing offsets do not move, which keeps the next diff small.
    // @52 -- DXGI'S OWN COUNT OF THIS CHAIN'S PRESENTS SINCE THE PREVIOUS HOOKED ONE,
    // beyond that one (2026-09-05, 20_OPEN_QUESTIONS §H5 row P1-DXGI). The per-present
    // form of FlWriterState.dxgiPresentsUnseen: the delta of GetLastPresentCount between
    // two consecutive hooked presents on the same chain, minus the one present the hook
    // saw. Measured 2.90 and 2.95 per hooked present on Dying Light: The Beast
    // (Streamline 2.8.0, DLSS Frame Generation x4) and 0 on every other title (Streamline
    // 2.7.3 and 2.10.3 present their generated frames through the patched bodies) -- so
    // on that shape the generated presents ARE DXGI presents, reaching a body the inline
    // patches do not cover, and the consumer counts Displayed = hooked + this, labelled
    // DXGI-COUNTED. Per record rather than per session so the consumer's uniformity
    // buckets see it. SATURATES AT 255: a NUMERATOR, so a wrap would read low rather than
    // high, but 255 is still a sentinel the consumer refuses rather than a count. Took the
    // first byte of v3's reserved word; additive, no offset moved, no layout bump.
    // A COUNTER THAT WENT BACKWARDS IS NOT A DELTA (2026-09-14, fl_dxgi_count.h): a chain
    // re-created at the same address inherits the slot's old count, and the unsigned
    // difference wrapped to ~4e9 -- saturating this byte at 255 (the DxgiSaturated refusal)
    // and adding the wrap to @48. On a regression the present claims no delta, exactly as
    // a chain's first hooked present does, and the slot re-arms on the new reading.

    // hook sees EVERY IDXGISwapChain in the process — measured: five different
    // configurations, D3D11 and D3D12, WARP and hardware, composition and HWND,
    // all report the identical vtable, and a detour installed via one catches
    // presents made through another. A title with a separate UI or video-playback
    // swapchain therefore inflates F_disp, and 03_METRICS defines Displayed FPS
    // as count(F_disp)/D with no way to tell the streams apart.
