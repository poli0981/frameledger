// `slEvaluateFeature`.
//
// This is the module the Overlay's inventory says that symbol may be taken from,
// and the one whose calls must be counted.
//
// The signature comes from the VENDORED MIT HEADER, not from a second hand-typed
// declaration, so the stub and the Overlay's detour cannot disagree about the
// ABI they are both compiled against. If they disagreed the fixture would still
// pass -- the harness would call one shape and the hook would forward another --
// which is the class of green-but-wrong this file exists to prevent.

// The vendor header's OWN export switch, which is what an implementer of this
// ABI is expected to define: SL_INTERPOSER turns SL_API into
// `extern "C" __declspec(dllexport)`. Using it rather than bolting dllexport
// onto our own definition means the exported name and linkage come from the
// header both sides compile against, so the stub cannot drift from the
// declaration the Overlay's detour is typed by.
//
// FrameLedger.Overlay must NEVER define this. It would turn every SL_API
// declaration into an export and our injected DLL would start exporting
// `slEvaluateFeature` — announcing an API it does not implement, inside somebody
// else's game.
