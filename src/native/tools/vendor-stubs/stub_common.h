//
// WHAT THESE ARE FOR. 17_HOOK_ENGINE §Hook inventory calls a wrong symbol name
// degrading silently to `unknown` "the highest false-confidence risk in the
// spike", and until now nothing tested it: a typo in the Overlay's symbol string
// produces a writer that resolves nothing, installs nothing, and reports exactly
// what an honest writer on a title with no upscaler reports. Green everywhere.
//
// A stub DLL carrying the MEASURED vendor name turns that into an observable
// event -- the Overlay either finds this function or it does not, and the
// difference is a counter.
//
// WHAT THEY ARE NOT. No vendor code, no vendor behaviour, and no claim about the
// real ABI beyond the one thing the vendored MIT header already tells us: the
// signature. These export a name and count calls. They are fixtures, they live
// under tools/ and never under third_party/ (tools/license-check.ps1 keys on
// that directory and would demand a licence file for our own code), and nothing
// ships them -- 12_BUILD publishes FrameLedger.App and FrameLedger.Agent only.
//
// THE NAME IS BOUND TO THE OVERLAY'S, NOT TYPED TWICE. InventoryHas() below is a
// constexpr walk of FL_HOOK_INVENTORY, so a stub asserting a name the inventory
// no longer contains FAILS TO COMPILE. That is the §S29(b) lesson applied before
// it bites: `ctest fl_vtable_indices` once proved a fact about dxgi.dll rather
// than about FrameLedger.Overlay, because the harness kept its own copy of the
// constants. A stub exporting its own hand-typed "slEvaluateFeature" would be
// the same defect wearing a vendor's name -- the fixture would pass while the
// Overlay looked for something else.
