// fl-probe-interposer — does a vtable-slot present hook see a Streamline title's
// presents? (docs/20_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md §H5 case 3, docs/spike-notes.md §5.)
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it runs in OUR OWN PROCESS.
//
// docs/03_METRICS.md §Counting native vs displayed defines F_disp as "presents
// observed by the hook" and F_app as "sum(fgEvaluations)" -- the 2026-08-14 owner
// ruling; this comment carried the pre-ruling subtraction until the producer
// landed. Both rest on one unverified assumption: that the object a game calls
// Present on is an instance of the class whose shared dxgi.dll vtable we patched.
// If a Streamline title's GENERATED presents go out through a different class, our
// present count collapses to the application frames alone, presents == sum, and
// fg_factor is STRUCTURALLY 1.0 -- the same failure the GetFrameStatistics rung was
// deleted for (03_METRICS "not conservative; silently wrong"), landing on the exact
// metric CLAUDE.md rule 6 exists to protect.
//
// hook-harness cannot answer it. Its --probe-proxy builds OUR OWN forwarding
// wrapper, which is the easy case by construction; §H5 lists the interposer as
// the case the harness structurally cannot reach.
//
// So this probe loads the real sl.interposer.dll -- from a title the user
// already has installed, named on the command line, never shipped by us -- into
// a process we own, and compares vtables. No game runs, no injection happens, no
// guard is involved, and nothing is written anywhere.
//
// WHY IT NOW USES THE VENDORED HEADERS, having deliberately avoided them.
//
// This file used to say "it needs no vendor headers", and that was correct when
// written: reaching the engaged path needs slInit's sl::Preferences, i.e. vendor
// ABI, and legal/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md settles for Intel IGCL that "re-declaring
// the API by hand is explicitly NOT an approved workaround". So the probe could
// only measure PASSTHROUGH and reported INCONCLUSIVE, which is what it did.
//
// PR #64 vendored the Streamline headers under MIT, after this file was written.
// The blocker is gone: sl::Preferences is sl_core_types.h:549 and slInit is
// sl_core_api.h:83, both MIT, neither re-declared here. 20_OPEN_QUESTIONS §S24
// records the unblock; §H5 case 3's own text still said "blocked on a licence
// decision" and is corrected in this PR.
//
// STILL RESOLVED WITH GetProcAddress, AND THAT IS NOT OPTIONAL. The headers are
// for types only. Calling slInit by name would make sl.interposer.dll a
// load-time dependency of this executable -- and Part 1 of this probe is
// `ctest fl_vtable_identity_control`, which runs on CI, where no Streamline
// exists. Linking it would turn the control into a test that cannot start on the
// one machine that runs it. Same rule as the Overlay, for a different reason.
