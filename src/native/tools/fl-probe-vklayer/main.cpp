// fl-probe-vklayer — proves the Vulkan layer's blocklist self-scan (§S2, second
// half) actually discriminates.
//
// An implicit layer is mapped into a process before anything of ours runs, so
// the injection guard structurally cannot cover it. The layer therefore runs
// its own version of pre-injection check 1 against ITSELF at init, and goes
// fully passthrough on any hit.
//
// This probe loads the layer DLL and calls its self-scan twice: once in a clean
// process, and once after loading a HARMLESS DLL RENAMED to look like an
// anti-cheat module — the fixture 14_TESTING §Integration tests specifies
// ("a renamed harmless DLL, not real anti-cheat software"). Without the second
// half the first proves nothing: a self-scan that always says "stay inert"
// would pass a one-sided test and silently disable the layer everywhere.
//
// Nothing here registers the layer with the Vulkan loader and nothing calls a
// Vulkan entry point. The DLL is loaded as an ordinary library and asked a
// question.
//
// The layer reads rules from the ONE location the product uses — under
// %LOCALAPPDATA% — and there is deliberately no way to point it elsewhere; a
// rules path that could be overridden is exactly the hole §S3 closed. So when
// that file is absent the probe INSTALLS THE REPOSITORY SEED THERE and removes
// it afterwards. It never touches an existing file: on a machine with real
// rules installed, those are what gets used.
//
// Without that, this test skipped on any machine that had not run the product
// — and a ctest that always skips is a gate that cannot fail, which is the
// defect class this project keeps finding.
