// The SPSC frame ring (docs/14_TESTING.md §Native unit tests, the suite
// src/native/tests/CMakeLists.txt has carried as TODO(P1) since Catch2 landed).
//
// Every case here forces a property docs/07_IPC.md §Protocol rules states.
//
// WHAT IS PROVEN RED, AND WHAT IS NOT. Four canaries were run against the writer
// and reader (2026-08-05); the suite must be read as covering only what actually
// went red, because a property whose red path has never been exercised is
// unverified however many assertions surround it.
//
//   PROVEN RED
//     - `seq` reset on every write  ->  the one-full-lap case fails.
//     - reader ignores the in-flight (odd) bit  ->  the torn-record case fails.
//
//   NOT PROVEN RED — these two properties are currently UNVERIFIED
//     - writer memcpy's all 64 bytes instead of stepping over `seq`.
//     - reader skips the second `seq` load and never revalidates.
//
// Both survive because the damage is only observable inside the write window,
// which is a 64-byte memcpy — nanoseconds — and neither the 1024-slot nor the
// 8-slot concurrency case lands in it reliably even across 200,000 records. The
// single-threaded cases structurally cannot see it: the trailing
// seq.store(s + 2) tidies the clobbered value away, so the final state of a
// correct writer and a 64-byte-copying one is identical.
//
// Recorded rather than papered over. Closing it needs either a seam that widens
// the window under test, or a dedicated sampling thread that only reads `seq` —
// and until one exists, "the payload write steps over seq" rests on review, not
// on this suite. The poisoned kPoisonSeq below and the tiny-ring case were both
// added trying to close it and did not; they are kept because they are the right
// shape and would catch a wider window.
