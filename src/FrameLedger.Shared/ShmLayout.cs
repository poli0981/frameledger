// The C# half of the shared-memory ABI. The C++ half is
// src/native/FrameLedger.Shm/include/fl_shm.h and it is NORMATIVE: where the two
// disagree, that header is right and this file is the bug.
//
// WHY THESE ARE FIXED BUFFERS AND NOT [MarshalAs(ByValTStr)] string.
//
// The obvious idiom for a native `char[32]` is
// `[MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.ByValTStr, SizeConst = 32)] public string BuildId`,
// and this repository already uses it once (NativeAntiCheatGuard's FlGuardResult,
// which is fine there -- that struct crosses a P/Invoke boundary, where the
// marshaller runs). It would pass every offset assertion in the mirror test and
// still be wrong here, because a struct containing a `string` is NOT BLITTABLE:
// it cannot be read straight out of a MemoryMappedViewAccessor, which is the one
// thing this type exists to do. The test asserts blittability directly
// (RuntimeHelpers.IsReferenceOrContainsReferences) precisely because offsets
// cannot see the difference.
//
// Every struct is `Size = 64` to match `alignas(64)` on the native side. The
// three header regions are separate cache lines on purpose (fl_shm.h): the
// Overlay writes region 2 every frame while the Agent writes region 3 every
// second, and sharing a line would put a cross-process cache-line bounce on the
// hot path.
