/// <b>This exists because <c>System.Diagnostics.Process</c> does not do it, and the
/// difference was measured rather than reasoned about.</b> The capture host's first

/// stated grounds that "a handle opened once keeps the identity pinned". A probe over
/// the live object on .NET 10.0.10 found <c>_haveProcessHandle == false</c> and
/// <c>_processHandle == null</c> both after construction and after reading
/// <c>HasExited</c>: <c>GetProcessById</c> opens nothing, and <c>HasExited</c> opens a
/// transient handle and releases it in its own <c>finally</c>. **No handle was held at
/// any point and the pid was never reserved**, so the mechanism three files and one
/// ledger entry claimed did not exist.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// That mattered twice. Between resolving a pid and injecting into it there is an
/// awaited file read, so an exit-and-recycle in that window would have injected into a
/// stranger on the strength of a consent record for a different binary — the anti-cheat
/// gate still scans the real pid, so not a rule-2 bypass, but a rule-1 one. And
/// mid-session, <c>HasExited</c> against a recycled pid answers about the NEW process,
/// so the session would never end.
