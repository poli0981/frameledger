    // That is a worse outcome than any other DLL-hijack in this application, so
    // the search path is not merely restricted — it is never consulted. The
    // assembly's one resolver (Native/BesideThisAssembly) loads exactly one file
    // for this name, beside this assembly, by full path, and throws when it is
    // absent: `required: true` below is that policy.
    //
    // The DefaultDllImportSearchPaths attributes are the belt to that braces:
    // System32 is the most restrictive value the analyzers accept, and if the
    // resolver were ever removed the fallback would still not probe the
    // application directory. CA5393 rejects ApplicationDirectory for exactly
    // the reason this comment exists.
