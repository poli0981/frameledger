/// counts from two different dispatch types — PREPARE's <c>frameID</c> (what <c>fgEvaluations</c>
/// carries once a title has ever prepared) and the UPSCALE dispatches (what it carries
/// otherwise, and what names the identity byte on the presents that drained one). A title
/// that generates frames issues exactly one of each per application frame, so
/// <see cref="FramesPerUpscale"/> reads <c>1.00</c> when the two agree, <c>2.00</c> when one of
/// them is doubled — a row for the loader as well as the leaf, or a title with two upscale
/// contexts per frame — and nothing else can see either.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Derived from the record, and only the record.</b> An UPSCALE drained is a present whose
/// identity byte names an FSR value (the writer names it only on such a present); a
/// FRAMEGENERATION drained is a present whose <c>fgMode</c> is <c>FSR_FG</c>. Both are the
/// decoded bytes rather than raw fact bits, because <see cref="FlFeatureFlags"/> has no free
/// bit for a raw AMD fact and adding one is a layout change — so unlike <see cref="SlCensus"/>
/// this census MOVES if the decode moves, and is evidence about the counts, not about which
/// descriptor type arrived.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>On a title with both vendors loaded</b> (UE5: <c>sl.interposer.dll</c> beside the two AMD
