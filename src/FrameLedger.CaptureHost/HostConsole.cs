/// Not a convenience. Three analyzers make direct <c>Console.WriteLine</c> calls a

/// synchronous write inside an <c>async</c> method blocks, and CA1303 because every

/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Routing through one non-async method answers all three honestly rather than by
/// suppression: the writes are no longer inside an async method, and the strings
/// are no longer literals at a <c>Console</c> call site. The <c>.resx</c> rule is
/// untouched — <c>09_I18N</c> scopes it to the shipped app's user-visible strings,
/// and this binary ships to nobody and is English-only by design. That scope is
/// written into <c>09_I18N</c> in the same PR rather than left implied.
