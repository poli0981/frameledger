/// <c>ShouldUnhookAsync</c>, an in-session re-scan that published no
/// <c>guardTicks</c> and did not latch — and it was deleted rather than repaired
/// (<c>20_OPEN_QUESTIONS</c> §S29(c)). Those two properties are the entire point
/// of <see cref="GuardSupervisor"/>, so a second route that had neither was a way
/// for the supervision counter to quietly stop meaning what it says: a drain loop
/// already holds this object, which made the weaker API the more discoverable one.
/// The polarity differed too — <c>ShouldUnhookAsync</c> returning <c>true</c> meant
/// STOP, while <see cref="GuardSupervisor.ScanOnceAsync"/> returning <c>true</c>
