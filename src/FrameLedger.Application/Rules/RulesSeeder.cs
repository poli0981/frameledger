/// "leave a file we did not install alone" is not an override; at worst it is a

/// <c>IsTrustedSigner</c> has no production call site while §S19(b) is deferred —
/// and it becomes live the moment the signer half is wired. That is a
/// prerequisite of §S19(b), recorded here because this is the class that made a
/// foreign file reachable.
