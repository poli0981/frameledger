# 17 — Hook engine (`FrameLedger.Overlay`, C++20)

The injected DLL. Its whole job: install hooks, write 64-byte records into a ring, stay invisible in the frame budget, and never take the game down.

## Build profile

- C++20, MSVC v143+, x64 only, `/MT` (static CRT — never drag a VC runtime dependency into a host process we don't control).

> **x64-only is a scope decision with a user-visible consequence, stated here so
> it is not rediscovered during implementation.** An x64 DLL cannot be loaded
> into a 32-bit process, and Direct3D 9 titles — the visual-novel, JRPG and older
> indie catalogue — are almost entirely 32-bit. **D3D9 is therefore not a Tier-1
> API in v1**, and 32-bit games of any API are Tier 2 — which since 2026-08-28 means
> **not measured at all**, not "measured by a lesser route". Shipping a second 32-bit
> Overlay and injector would restore them, at the cost of doubling the native
> build matrix and adding a second struct-mirror surface; that trade is recorded
> in `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §Scope rather than left implicit in a build flag.
- `/GS /guard:cf /Qspectre`, `/O2`, no RTTI (`/GR-`), C++ exceptions disabled in this target (`-D_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=0`); error handling is return codes + SEH. **Both of the contentious flags are verified, not assumed** (`20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §H1/§H3, `spike-notes.md` §3): `/guard:cf` coexists with MinHook trampolines because Windows treats `VirtualAlloc`'d executable memory as a valid CFG call target, and `std::atomic_ref` is lock-free at both widths under `-D_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=0`. The `fl_hook_profile` ctest re-checks both on every build.

  > ⚠ Know what `-D_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=0` actually buys. MSVC's STL does not delete its failure paths under that define — it rewrites `_THROW(x)` to `(x)._Raise()` and `_RAISE` to `__fastfail(5)`. Inside an injected DLL that means **a would-be exception kills the host game**, uncatchably, which SEH cannot intercept. It is safe here only because the hot path uses no throwing STL at all (`<atomic>`, `<cstdint>` and `<type_traits>` have zero throw-sites). That makes "no STL containers that allocate in hook paths" a load-bearing rule, not a style preference.
  >
  > ⚠ The CFG result was measured with **strict mode off**. A host that enables CFG strict mode does not auto-validate dynamically generated code and could still `__fastfail`. Rare, but real, and not something the fault policy can catch — see §Fault policy and `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §H8.
- No STL container that allocates in a hook path. `std::atomic` and fixed arrays are fine.
- VERSIONINFO populated (`ProductName=FrameLedger`, real company/version) — being identifiable is required by `19_SAFETY`.
- Exports: `FlGetBuildId()`, `FlRequestUnhook()`, `FlGetStatus()`. Real names, no ordinal-only tricks.

## DLL entry

`DllMain(DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)` does **only**: `DisableThreadLibraryCalls`, then `CreateThread` → `InitThread`. Nothing else — loader lock rules. All real work (dummy-device creation, MinHook init, hook installation, shm creation) happens on `InitThread`.

`InitThread` order:
1. Open/create shared memory `Local\FrameLedger.Ring.<pid>`; write the handshake header (layout version, build id, pid, api=unknown).
2. `MH_Initialize()`.
3. Resolve which graphics APIs are present (`GetModuleHandleW` on `d3d11.dll`, `d3d12.dll`, `dxgi.dll`, `opengl32.dll`) — and register a `LoadLibrary` hook so APIs loaded **later** still get hooked (many games load D3D12 lazily). **The `LoadLibrary` hook must not install hooks inline:** it runs under the loader lock, and MinHook suspends all threads to patch, which deadlocks against any thread waiting on that lock. It enqueues the request and signals the init thread, which installs outside the lock (`20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §H2).

4. Install present hooks for what exists (below).
5. Install feature hooks (upscaler / RT / PSO) lazily — the first time their module appears.
6. Publish `status = ready` in the handshake block.

## Getting vtable addresses (COM)

Never hardcode vtable indices. Create a throwaway object, read the pointer, hook the pointer:

```cpp
// D3D11/DXGI: create a 1x1 swapchain on a dummy HWND (or DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_FLIP_DISCARD w/ CreateSwapChainForComposition)
// D3D12: D3D12CreateDevice(nullptr, D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_11_0, ...) then dummy command queue + swapchain
void** vtbl = *reinterpret_cast<void***>(dummySwapChain);
MH_CreateHook(vtbl[kPresentIndex], &Hook_Present, reinterpret_cast<void**>(&Orig_Present));
```

Index constants (`IDXGISwapChain::Present = 8`, `Present1 = 22` on `IDXGISwapChain1`, `ResizeBuffers = 13`) live in `HookIndices.h`.

> ⚠ **"Verified at runtime against the dummy object" is not implementable, and
> must not be reintroduced.** A vtable slot holds a bare function pointer: no
> name, no signature, nothing identifying which method it is. Reading `vtbl[8]`
> tells you an address, not that the address is `Present`. The only runtime
> checks available are structural — non-null, inside a mapped image, table long

Prefer hooking the **vtable entry** over inline-patching for COM methods (cleaner uninstall, no trampoline hazards); use MinHook inline hooks for flat C exports (`wglSwapBuffers`, NGX/FFX/XeSS entry points).

## Hook inventory

Every hook must be listed here with a purpose. Anything not on this list is not allowed to exist (`19_SAFETY` review checklist).

> **This table is a SPECIFICATION. As of 2026-09-04 the Overlay installs TWELVE DETOURS —
> the eight of 2026-09-03 plus four `ffxDispatch` trampolines, one per AMD module a game
> calls — and the FidelityFX row below is the ninth ✅.** The counts differed until 2026-09-03, because a
> row is a *capability* and a detour is a *patch*, and the FG-count row rode on the

> names and each must be patched at its own address; and its family is published only once **every leaf the
> process has loaded** is patched, which is `PublishHookFamily`'s own rule and was measured

> watchdog. The sixth ✅ row, **FG evaluations per present, has no detour of its own**:

### The one system-module detour — a hook, and the asymmetry stated

| Hook | Purpose |
|---|---|
| ✅ `opengl32.dll!wglSwapBuffers` (2026-09-06, P1 item 4) | The OpenGL present hook (§Presentation). A system module, not a vendor one, so — like the row below — it is deliberately **not** in `FL_HOOK_INVENTORY` and `hookinventory-check` does not cover it; listed here so the table above and these two rows together are the whole inventory |
| ✅ `kernelbase.dll!LoadLibraryExW` (2026-09-06, P1 item 1) | The wake for lazily loaded runtimes and the in-process anti-cheat stop — §DLL entry step 3 above carries the mechanism. **Rule 4:** it reads one argument the API was given (`flags`) and one property of a handle the loader just returned to *its own caller* (the module file name); nothing of the game's. **It is the only hook on a system module, and it is deliberately not in `FL_HOOK_INVENTORY`:** that table is *vendor* symbols resolved by name and gated by `hookinventory-check` against `vendor-exports.json`, and `LoadLibraryExW` is neither vendor nor uncertain. It is listed here instead so the table above and this row together are the whole inventory. It **never** installs, uninstalls or patches anything itself (§H2) |

### Watchdog observations — not hooks, and listed here so nobody mistakes them for one

| Observation | Mechanism | Rule 4 | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Runtime census** (`FlWriterState.runtimeCensus`, 2026-09-03) | Once a second on the watchdog: `GetModuleHandleExW(UNCHANGED_REFCOUNT)` for each name in `FL_RUNTIME_CENSUS` (`fl_hook_inventory.h`); OR-ed into the writer state. No enumeration, no reference, no patch, nothing on the present path | A module-name question to the loader — the same class `ResolveScoped` already asks before installing a hook. Reads no game memory | Rung 0 of `03_METRICS`' FG ladder is where every title lands today, and without this a 2D title and a DLSS-G title on an unhooked route printed the same line. **Never a producer of `NONE`** — statically linked FSR has no module to see. Names gated by `hookinventory-check` Pass D against the measured module list |

### Presentation
| Hook | Purpose |
|---|---|
| ✅ `IDXGISwapChain::Present`, `Present1` | Frame boundary, QPC, sync interval, present flags. **`DXGI_PRESENT_TEST` calls are dropped without a record** — the occlusion probe submits nothing, and a minimised game emits a stream of them (`07_IPC` §Protocol rules). **Since 2026-09-05 the hook also reads `IDXGISwapChain::GetLastPresentCount` on the chain it just saw** (rule 4: the same COM object `FindOrAdd` already calls `GetDesc` on, no new hook) and publishes `dxgiPresentSamples` / `dxgiPresentsUnseen` — DXGI's count of presents on that chain that this hook never saw, the in-process half of `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §H5 Leg 1. One virtual call per hooked present, costed by `hook-harness --probe-frames`. **And per record since the same night: `dxgiUnseen` @52 under `FL_MEASURED_DXGI_PRESENTS`**, so the consumer's window counts `Displayed = hooked + unseen` per bucket (`03_METRICS` §Displayed may be DXGI-COUNTED) — measured 2.90 / 2.95 on DL:TB at Streamline 2.8.0, 0 on 2.7.3 and 2.10.3. **And since 2026-09-06 (P1 item 2) the same read, at the FIRST hooked present on the first hooked chain, is published once as `FlWriterState.dxgiPresentsBeforeHook` @60** — DXGI's count of presents that ran before the hook was in, launch mode's cost meter (`20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §S1); 0xFFFFFFFF until a present is seen, set before the present hooks go in. **Corrected 2026-09-14 (`fl_dxgi_count.h`, ctest `fl_dxgi_count`):** a reading that went *backwards* — a chain released and re-created at the same address inherits the slot's old count — used to wrap `now − previous` to ~4e9, saturate the record byte at 255 (the `DxgiSaturated` refusal) and add the wrap to the session total: the owner's ledger held `dxgi_unseen_total = 4294967243`. A regression is now a reset (no delta claimed, nothing added, the slot re-armed) and the total saturates at `UINT32_MAX` rather than wrapping. Cost: one compare on the same virtual call; measured per `14_TESTING` §Hook overhead in the PR |
| ✅ `IDXGISwapChain::ResizeBuffers` · ⏳ `ResizeTarget` | Output resolution changes mid-session. `ResizeBuffers` re-reads the swapchain description *after* the original returns; `ResizeTarget` is not hooked |
| ⏳ `IDXGISwapChain::SetFullscreenState` | Fullscreen ↔ borderless transitions |
| ⏳ `IDXGISwapChain3::SetColorSpace1` | HDR output detection. **`IDXGISwapChain3`, not 4** — 4 adds only `SetHDRMetaData` (`20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §H9 — *answered and removed with H1/H3/H4 in the P0 spike (`6b1fa83`); this row used to say `IDXGISwapChain4`, and the corrected interface here IS the answer, so the citation points at history rather than at a live entry*). Unbuilt, which is why `colorSpace` reads `NOT_REPORTED` and `FL_MEASURED_HDR` stays clear. **When it is built, the writer must initialise `colorSpace = FL_COLOR_SPACE_SDR` at swapchain identification** — an SDR title never calls `SetColorSpace1`, so "hook live, no call" would otherwise sit at `NOT_REPORTED` forever and HDR's definite `No` would be unreachable. DXGI documents G22/Rec.709 as the default, which makes SDR a *measured* default rather than an affirmative negative |
| ⏳ `IDXGIFactory::CreateSwapChain*` | Capture swapchain desc (format, buffer count, swap effect, flags) at creation. Unbuilt — the swapchain description is currently read on demand in the present hook via `GetDesc` |
| ✅ `wglSwapBuffers` (2026-09-06, P1 item 4) | OpenGL titles: one record per `opengl32!wglSwapBuffers`, `api` = OpenGL, the output size from `GetClientRect` on the window the HDC belongs to (first sighting and every 256th present, so a resize is caught without a second hook), **no `FL_MEASURED_PRESENT_ARGS`** — the call has no sync interval and no flags. A MinHook inline patch on the flat export (measured 2026-08-05: a `jmp` thunk into the vendor ICD, relocated like any first instruction), installed at init when `opengl32.dll` is already mapped and lazily on the watchdog otherwise, with the `LoadLibrary` detour waking it for `opengl32.dll`. Exercised by `hook-harness --opengl --hold-presenting N`, which calls **gdi32's `SwapBuffers`** the way a title does — measured to reach the hook (ctest `fl_guard` `[opengl]`, on Microsoft's generic renderer, so it runs on CI too). The one system-module row below carries the inventory asymmetry |
| ✅ Vulkan `vkQueuePresentKHR` (2026-09-06, P1 item 3) | via layer, not hook (below). Frame boundary and QPC, one record per present; `vkCreateSwapchainKHR` / `vkDestroySwapchainKHR` intercepted beside it for the output size (`imageExtent`, the API's own argument — rule 4). **No `FL_MEASURED_PRESENT_ARGS`**: `vkQueuePresentKHR` carries no sync interval and no flags, which is why that bit exists. §S2's in-layer supervision check landed with it, on the present path. Measured under the real loader on the harness's `--vulkan` mode: 241 records in 4 s, status READY, `apiMask` = Vulkan (ctest `fl_vklayer_real`) |

### Upscaling / frame generation (the accuracy problem this rewrite exists to solve)
| Hook | Yields |
|---|---|
| NGX: `NVSDK_NGX_D3D11/D3D12/VULKAN_CreateFeature`, `EvaluateFeature`, `ReleaseFeature` | Which NGX feature is *actually created and evaluated per frame*: SuperSampling (DLSS), RayReconstruction (DLSS-D), FrameGeneration (DLSS-G) |
| NGX parameter accessors (`NVSDK_NGX_Parameter_SetI/GetI/SetUI`) — **exported by `sl.common.dll` only; see below** | `Width`/`Height` (render) vs `OutWidth`/`OutHeight` (output), `PerfQualityValue` (quality preset), sharpness |
| ✅ Streamline: `slEvaluateFeature` · ⏳ `slInit`, `slSetFeatureLoaded`, `slSetConstants`, `slGetFeatureRequirements` | Feature set actually active when the game goes through SL rather than NGX directly (`kFeatureDLSS`, `DLSS_G`, `DLSS_RR`, `Reflex`, `NIS`). **Built 2026-08-09**, identity only: one MinHook detour on `sl.interposer.dll!slEvaluateFeature`, resolved **module-scoped** and installed lazily by the watchdog. Sets `FL_MEASURED_UPSCALER` + `FL_HOOK_UPSCALER_IDENTITY`; decodes `kFeatureDLSS`/`kFeatureNIS` and reports `FL_UPSCALER_UNKNOWN` for anything else. **Never `FL_UPSCALER_NONE`** — a Streamline-only writer cannot see FFX, XeSS or NGX-direct, and `NONE` is the only one of the three states that may be aggregated as a negative |
| ✅ Streamline: `slSetTag` — **and, since 2026-09-05, every tag's TYPE** (`slTagCensus`; a HUD-less / UI tag marks the present `FL_FG_DLSS_G`, rule 4: the same argument) | The **global** resource tags, where a title states the size of the buffer it is upscaling *from*: `kBufferTypeScalingInputColor`'s extent → `renderW/H` — **or, since 2026-09-05, the size the tagged `sl::Resource` declares when the extent is zero** (`TagSize` in `fl_sl_inputs.h`, shared by all three tag routes; GUID-checked; a Resource declaring no size is still the honest unknown). **Built 2026-08-15** (`FL_HOOK_UPSCALER_PARAMS`), and it is an ALTERNATIVE to the local tags in `slEvaluateFeature`'s `inputs`, not a layer over them — `sl_core_api.h:258` says global and local tags "do NOT interact", so a title using one yields nothing from the other and both are read. Published only on a frame where an evaluation was also seen, because a tag is viewport state that outlives any one frame. This row was MISSING from this table while the hook shipped, which is the gap the banner above now names |
| ✅ Streamline: `slSetTagForFrame` — **and every tag's TYPE, as above** | The same global tags through **Streamline 2.8's frame-based entry point**, which deprecates `slSetTag`: `(const FrameToken&, const ViewportHandle&, const ResourceTag*, uint32_t, CommandBuffer*)` — the token first, then exactly `slSetTag`'s list, handed to the same tag walk. **Built 2026-09-04** (`FL_HOOK_UPSCALER_PARAMS`, its own trampoline; the family is now **published when whole** — once every tag export the loaded interposer has is patched — because publishing on the first row entitled records the second was not yet producing, 38 of 41 on the fixture: the ffx leaves' #110 defect again, fixed the same way). Measured need: Dying Light: The Beast (SL 2.8.0) published `Dlss` identity on every batch and the params bit on none across three captures, because a 2.8 title that tags per frame never calls the deprecated export. The token is not read; the frame count stays with `slGetNewFrameToken`. The installer picks this detour by SYMBOL (`kSymbolSlSetTagForFrame`, bound to the row by `static_assert`), not by family, since the two rows share a family bit and differ in signature |
| ✅ **FidelityFX ffx-api: `ffxDispatch` on the FOUR modules a game calls** — `amd_fidelityfx_dx12.dll` (SDK 1.1.x monolith), `amd_fidelityfx_upscaler_dx12.dll`, `amd_fidelityfx_framegeneration_dx12.dll`, **and `amd_fidelityfx_loader_dx12.dll`** (added the evening of 2026-09-04: three loader-shipping titles at FSR produced zero dispatches at any leaf export, so the loader is where their calls arrive) · ⏳ FSR 3.0 host route `ffx_fsr3_x64.dll!ffxFsr3ContextDispatchUpscale` / `ffxFsr3DispatchFrameGeneration` · ~~`ffxFsr2ContextCreate`~~ · ~~`ffxCreateContext`~~ | **Built 2026-09-04** (`HANDOFF` item 7c). One observer behind three trampolines reads the DESCRIPTOR the title passed — head type first, body only after the type matched a constant from the vendored MIT headers (`third_party/fidelityfx/`, tag v2.3.0): **UPSCALE** → identity (`FSR3` from the monolith, `FSR_UNVERSIONED` from the 2.x upscaler DLL, which hosts FSR 3.1 and FSR 4 behind one type) + `renderSize` → `renderW/H` (quality and sharpness `0xFF`: the dispatch carries neither) + one COUNT; **PREPARE / PREPARE_V2** → `frameID` counted on a *new* index only — this vendor's `slGetNewFrameToken`, the `fgEvaluations` producer once a title has ever prepared, with the UPSCALE count as the fallback for a title that never does; **FRAMEGENERATION** → `fgMode = FSR_FG` on that present. Rule 4: the argument of the API we hooked, never `context`, `pNext`, a command list or a resource. **Why all four:** a UE5 title ships the two leaves with no loader and calls their exports; a loader-shipping title calls the loader's export and the signed loader reaches its providers through an object, not the leaves' exports (measured: Dying Light: The Beast, KCD2, Wukong). The morning's "never the loader" rested on the export tables alone and was reversed by the run. What guards against a loader that DID re-enter a leaf's export is the K = 1 control with all four hooked and the consumer's `frames/upscale-drained`, both of which read 2× in that case. `ffxCreateContext` is deliberately NOT a row — nothing it carries fills a field the dispatch does not, and its honest family would collide with `slEvaluateFeature`'s under the installer's equality binding. The family is compound (`IDENTITY \| PARAMS \| FG_EVALUATIONS`), pinned by `static_assert`s that also bind the leaf table to the rows both ways and refuse the loader as a row. Streamline keeps precedence for the count once it has ever issued a token, so every §S31-validated title is byte-identical. Second count: the consumer prints `frames/upscale-drained`, the AMD `tokens/batch`. **FSR 3.0 — BUILT 2026-09-05 as a fifth AMD target:** `ffx_fsr3_x64.dll!ffxFsr3ContextDispatchUpscale` (Cyberpunk's copy; named export, its own descriptor, vendored from tag **`fsr3-v3.0.4`** — the tag whose twelve `ffxFsr3*` declarations match the shipped module, not the `v1.1.4` first named). Rule 4: the detour reads `renderSize` of the descriptor the title passed and nothing else — never the context, a resource or the command list; the offset is pinned to a literal (1256) so a re-vendoring that moved it fails to compile. Same family and publish point as the four rows (`PublishFfxFamilyIfWhole` waits for a loaded host too), keyed by module in the installer; identity `FSR3` as a fact. `ffxFsr3DispatchFrameGeneration` is deliberately not a row (§H11 carries the reversal condition); the `ffx_fsr3upscaler_x64.dll` leaf is the pre-committed alternative if the facade reads silent (row B2) — never both, or `frames/upscale-drained` reads 2.00 |
| XeSS: `xessD3D12CreateContext`, `xessD3D12Init`, `xessD3D12Execute` | `outputResolution`, `qualitySetting`, XeSS version; `xess_fg` variants for XeFG |
| ✅ **Application frames per present** (`fgEvaluations`) — **`sl.interposer.dll!slGetNewFrameToken` since 2026-09-03** | Native vs Displayed frame counts at Tier 1 — see `03_METRICS` §Frame Generation. **The producer is the frame-token export**: Streamline hands a title one token per application frame and the title must ask; the detour counts distinct tokens between two presents (pointer changes, nothing dereferenced), `FL_HOOK_FG_EVALUATIONS` is its family, and it installs on every Streamline 2 title including the ones that evaluate nothing through `slEvaluateFeature`. Rule 4: the out-parameter of an API we hooked. Premise and its gate in `03_METRICS`; pre-committed table in `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §S31. *The row as it stood before:* ~~NGX/SL/FFX/XeSS FG feature evaluations per present. **Built 2026-08-15 for Streamline, and MEASURED TO YIELD NOTHING ON THAT ROUTE**~~ — `slEvaluateFeature(kFeatureDLSS_G)` is never called by Cyberpunk 2077 (0 across ~14,000 batches, four FG settings), so this row installs, is honest, and counts zero; see `docs/HANDOFF.md` item 3. Built on the detour that was already there: `kFeatureDLSS_G` contributes to a saturating COUNT in the same word the feature bits live in (`fl_sl_seen.h`) rather than to a bit, because a bit collapses several evaluations between two presents into one — and under multi-frame generation that is the common case, not the edge. The row's family is therefore compound (`FL_HOOK_UPSCALER_IDENTITY \| FL_HOOK_FG_EVALUATIONS`), pinned by a `static_assert` because `hookinventory-check` reads that column as an opaque identifier. **Counts EVALUATIONS, not generated frames** — the 2026-08-14 owner ruling; the multiplier lives in `sl::DLSSGOptions`, which is only reachable by the route §2b refused. ~~Non-NVIDIA FG vendors are **deferred with a written rationale**: `amd_fidelityfx_framegeneration_dx12.dll` 3.1.5 exports only the five generic `ffx*` entry points, identical to five sibling modules, so identity is in the arguments and we have no headers~~ — **AMD has a producer since 2026-09-04** (the FidelityFX row above: the PREPARE dispatch's `frameID`, or the UPSCALE count on a title that never prepares, feeds `fgEvaluations` when Streamline has never issued a token); Intel stays at the census (`20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §Scope decisions, by licence); the FSR 3.0 host DLL's UPSCALE (`ffxFsr3ContextDispatchUpscale`, since 2026-09-05) counts like an ffx-api UPSCALE when neither Streamline nor a PREPARE has spoken |

### The NGX parameter surface splits into two hook classes — measured

This is the finding P0 item 5 existed to produce, and it changes what the feature-hook phase has to build.

| Module | Exports the parameter **accessors** (`NVSDK_NGX_Parameter_SetI/GetI/…`) | Exports the parameter-object **factories** (`AllocateParameters`, `GetCapabilityParameters`, `GetParameters`) |
|---|---|---|
| `sl.common.dll` (Streamline) | **yes** — all 16 | yes |
| `nvngx.dll` / driver-store `_nvngx.dll` (NGX core) | **no** | yes, for D3D11/D3D12/Vulkan/CUDA |
| `nvngx_dlss.dll`, `nvngx_dlssg.dll`, `nvngx_dlssd.dll` | no | no |

So:

- **Streamline-shimmed titles** (9 of the installed titles here) expose the accessors as ordinary exported functions on `sl.common.dll`. An inline hook on `NVSDK_NGX_Parameter_SetUI` yields `PerfQualityValue` and the render/output pair directly. This is the case §Hook inventory already describes.

- **NGX-direct titles** call the core, which exports only the **factories**. The accessors are function pointers *inside* the `NVSDK_NGX_Parameter` object those factories return — so there is no symbol to hook. Reaching them means hooking `NVSDK_NGX_D3D12_AllocateParameters` / `GetCapabilityParameters` and reading or wrapping the returned object's function-pointer table.

**The second path needs its own justification against CLAUDE.md rule 4 before it is built, and it survives one.** Rule 4 permits "arguments passed to APIs we hooked and COM/handle objects we legitimately own". The parameter object is a handle returned by an API we hooked, in the same sense as an `IDXGISwapChain` — reading its function-pointer table is the same operation as reading a COM vtable, which §Getting vtable addresses already does. What it is **not** is pattern-scanning for game internals, and the distinction must stay in writing.

> `nvngx_dlss.dll` itself is a dead end for this purpose and should not be hooked for it: 59 exports, none of them parameter-related. It is the feature payload, not the API surface.

### Ray tracing
| Hook | Yields |
|---|---|
| `ID3D12Device5::CreateStateObject` | RT pipeline creation; read `D3D12_RAYTRACING_PIPELINE_CONFIG.MaxTraceRecursionDepth`, shader counts |
| ✅ `ID3D12GraphicsCommandList4::DispatchRays` | **Per-frame proof that rays are dispatched**, plus dispatch W×H×D (→ rays-per-pixel ratio, the main PT heuristic input) |
| ✅ `ID3D12GraphicsCommandList4::BuildRaytracingAccelerationStructure` | AS build/update activity — **catches inline RayQuery too**, which `DispatchRays` alone misses |
| Vulkan `vkCmdTraceRaysKHR`, `vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR` | Same, via layer |

> **✅ Both command-list rows are BUILT as of 2026-08-20, and the trap they hit is the part worth reading** (`spike-notes.md` §6, ctests `fl_dxr_probe` / `fl_d3d12_vtable_indices` / the injected `fl_guard` case).
>
> **A COMMAND LIST'S VTABLE IS NOT THE ONE YOU READ OFF A FRESH ONE.** The first `Reset()` replaces the class vtable with a **per-object** one in which the vendor driver has taken methods over. Measured on an RTX 5080: `DispatchRays` moves from `D3D12Core.dll` into `nvwgf2umx.dll`; `BuildRaytracingAccelerationStructure` stays in `D3D12Core.dll`. Every game resets its command lists every frame, so the addresses in an **unreset** list's vtable are ones no title ever calls for the moved methods.
>
> The first version of this hook did exactly that. It installed, published `FL_HOOK_RT_DISPATCH`, and never fired — the injected fixture recorded `withDispatch = 0` beside `hooks = RT_DISPATCH | RT_AS_BUILD`, a mask bit with nothing behind it. Because the *other* hook worked, it read as a bug in the dispatch detour rather than in the acquisition they share. **The rule this generalises to: put a throwaway object through the same lifecycle the game's objects go through, or it is not a sample of them.** §H5 says the same thing about swapchains one layer up.
>
> **What is patched, and what is not.** The Overlay MinHooks the FUNCTION a slot points at, never the slot. That matters because after `Reset` each list has its own vtable array, so a slot patch would have to be repeated per list, while one inline patch covers every list — measured, and also why DIRECT and COMPUTE need only one detour per method: they resolve to the same functions. The installer still compares the two and **refuses to install if they differ**, because one trampoline cannot serve two implementations and forwarding through the wrong one calls the wrong function inside the game. Degrading to `N/A` is the safe direction. Bundles are not a further case: `D3D12_COMMAND_LIST_TYPE_BUNDLE` does not permit `DispatchRays`, which is a documented API constraint rather than something measured here.
>
> **Where the list comes from.** Created on the **game's own device** — the `ID3D12Device` `ResolveApi` already receives from `IDXGISwapChain::GetDevice`, an object we legitimately own (CLAUDE.md rule 4) — closed, reset, read, and released immediately, exactly as `InstallPresentHooks` releases its dummy swapchain. **Not a throwaway WARP device**, and that is now a correctness requirement rather than a preference: a WARP list resolves `DispatchRays` to `D3D12Core.dll` while a hardware list resolves it to the driver, so a WARP-acquired target would silently miss every call on an NVIDIA GPU.
>
> **Every vendor-specific result here is ONE DRIVER'S.** Nothing says an AMD or Intel UMD splits the two methods the same way, or leaves either in `D3D12Core`. `--probe-dxr` Q5 prints the module on each side of the `Reset` so the next machine answers for itself instead of inheriting this.
>
> Slot numbers live in `fl_d3d12_vtable.h`, one header and two consumers, and `ctest fl_d3d12_vtable_indices` proves each by **behaviour** on both list types — the §S29(b) rule applied to a second interface.
>
> **These are vtable-derived hooks, so `FL_HOOK_INVENTORY` does not cover them and neither does `tools/hookinventory-check.ps1`.** No vendor symbol is resolved by name, so Pass A has no row to check and Pass B's stray-literal sweep is silent. Anyone reading §Hook inventory as "every hook we install is in that table" needs to know the other kind exists and that `fl_d3d12_vtable_indices` is its gate.

### Pipeline / stutter attribution
| Hook | Yields |
|---|---|
| `ID3D12Device::CreateGraphicsPipelineState` / `CreateComputePipelineState`, `ID3D12Device2::CreatePipelineState` | PSO compilations per frame → correlate with frame-time spikes = **shader-compilation stutter attribution** (a Tier-1-only feature; ETW cannot attribute this) |
| `ID3D11Device::CreateVertexShader`/`CreatePixelShader` | D3D11 equivalent, coarser |

### Memory / latency
| Hook / call | Yields |
|---|---|
| `IDXGIAdapter3::QueryVideoMemoryInfo` (we **call** it, not hook it, once per second from our own thread) | **Per-process VRAM** `CurrentUsage` + `Budget` — previously impossible; now exact |
| NVAPI Reflex: hook `NvAPI_D3D_SetSleepMode`, `NvAPI_D3D_SetLatencyMarker`; call `NvAPI_D3D_GetLatency` | Reflex on/off + PC latency breakdown. Declarations come from the vendored MIT NVAPI headers (`18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS` §L3); the Overlay links them like any other header. NVIDIA-only — the whole block compiles out to a no-op capability flag elsewhere |

### Explicitly not hooked
Input APIs, file I/O, network, memory allocators, window messages beyond what the overlay needs, anything game-specific. Rule 4 in CLAUDE.md.

## Vulkan: layer, not hook

Vulkan gets an **implicit layer** (`FrameLedger.VkLayer`), not injection — it is the mechanism Khronos supports, it is far more robust than hooking dispatch tables, and it is how OBS and RTSS do it.

- Manifest JSON registered under `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Khronos\Vulkan\ImplicitLayers` (per-user, no admin).
- Layer name **`VK_LAYER_FRAMELEDGER_overlay`** — uppercase vendor tag, per the
  loader's `VK_LAYER_<VENDOR>_<name>` convention. This is not pedantry: a
  non-conforming name makes the Vulkan loader emit a policy warning
  (`LLP_LAYER_3`) into every Vulkan application's log on the machine. Observed
  on the dev box, where GOG Galaxy's `GalaxyOverlayVkLayer` does exactly that
  and gets named in the warning three times. `19_SAFETY` requires us to be
  plainly identifiable and well behaved; a layer that announces itself as
  malformed is the wrong kind of visible. Every conforming layer on that
  machine uses an uppercase tag — `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_*`, `VK_LAYER_LUNARG_*`,
  `VK_LAYER_NV_*`, `VK_LAYER_VALVE_*`, `VK_LAYER_OBS_HOOK`, `VK_LAYER_RTSS`.
- Declare an API version at least as high as the applications we expect to
  layer. The same machine shows the loader warning that `VK_LAYER_OBS_HOOK` and
  `VK_LAYER_RTSS` declare 1.3 against a 1.4 application, "may cause issues".
- **`enable_environment` (`FRAMELEDGER_ENABLE_VK_LAYER=1`)**, plus
  `disable_environment` so a user can force us off — the latter is Vulkan
  convention and stays. Measured against loader 1.4.357 (`spike-notes.md` §2):
  with the variable unset the loader locates our manifest and **never maps the
  DLL**, and it compares the variable's **value**, so a stray
  `FRAMELEDGER_ENABLE_VK_LAYER=0` does not enable us. **This makes Vulkan
  Tier 1 launch-mode-only** — the Agent sets the variable when it starts an
  opted-in game, so a Vulkan title launched from Steam or GOG is not hooked.
  It is a *loading* gate, not a security gate: anything running as the user can
  set the variable.

### Never decline to load — accept, then be inert

So the layer **always accepts negotiation and always forwards**. Returning
`nullptr` from `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` as a way to opt out is the same class of
failure and is equally forbidden — handing the loader a null `vkCreateInstance`
breaks the application just as thoroughly.

The enable-list decides **what we intercept**, never **whether we load**. Being
present and inert costs a pointer forward per call; being absent by erroring out
is not something this loader supports.

- Intercepts `vkQueuePresentKHR`, `vkCreateSwapchainKHR`, `vkCmdTraceRaysKHR`, `vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR`, `vkCreateGraphicsPipelines`.

  > **Built 2026-09-06 (P1 item 3): the first two, plus `vkDestroySwapchainKHR`; the three feature entries are still ⏳.** How the capture side works, stated once:
  > - **The ring is the same ring.** `fl_shm_host.h` (header-only, in `FrameLedger.Shm`) now holds the user-only DACL, the `Local\FrameLedger.Ring.<pid>` name, the mapping and the handshake for **both** capture sides; the Overlay calls it too. **One ring per process: whichever side creates the mapping first owns it, the other sees `ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS` and stays inert** — and stays *forwarding*: the layer registers every device's next pointers before it tries the ring, because a hook with nothing to forward to failed the application's present (measured, `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` on the harness, the first time the Overlay got there first). That is also why the launch-mode guard **does not inject a presenter that mapped `vulkan-1.dll`** (`Reason::kTargetIsVulkanLayered`, `fl_guard.cpp`) — with or without a D3D runtime beside it, because **an NVIDIA Vulkan ICD maps `dxgi.dll` + `d3d12.dll` itself and presents the Vulkan swapchain through a DXGI flip chain** (measured on the harness's `--vulkan` mode: classified as D3D, the injected Overlay recorded 295 DXGI presents of a Vulkan swapchain and the layer forwarded into nothing). The layer is the capture side for anything that maps the Vulkan loader; a D3D title that happens to is the rarer shape and the one this rule gets wrong.
  > - **It comes up at the first admitted `vkCreateDevice`**, never at load and never at `vkCreateInstance`, so a process either gate refused never has a mapping with its pid on it. Init is not a hook path; the present hook is, and it follows the Overlay's rules — SEH-guarded, allocation-free, lock-free, three faults → `SELF_DISABLED`.
  > - **§S2 part three, the in-layer supervision, runs on the present path**, because the layer may not own a thread (the loader owns its mapping). `guardTicks` not advancing for `FL_GUARD_TICK_DEADLINE_MS` → `FL_STATUS_UNHOOKED`; `unhookRequested` → the same within one present; `pauseRequested` → no record, still forwarded. "Stops" means **passthrough forever with the reason on the mapping** — a layer cannot leave a running game's loader chain. A title that stops presenting is not stopped by the deadline, and has nothing to be observed either. Proven with a test-only flavour of the DLL whose deadline is 1.5 s (`fl_vklayer_shortdeadline`, never shipped; ctest `fl_vklayer_supervision`).
  > - **No registry for the operator host.** Loader 1.4.357 honours `VK_ADD_IMPLICIT_LAYER_PATH` (measured 2026-09-06, `spike-notes` §2): the CaptureHost's `launch` writes a manifest under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FrameLedger\vklayer`, points the launched process at it, sets the enable variable and adds the image name to the enable-list for the session — discoverable by that process alone, gone when it ends. The Agent's HKCU registration (`12_BUILD`) is unchanged and remains P2's.
- The layer respects the same guard, in two steps at init: it checks the enable-list, and it scans **its own process** against the anti-cheat blocklist. Either one saying no means fully passthrough. **A layer is machine-wide by nature — these checks are mandatory, not optional.**
- The self-scan uses the **same matcher and the same rules file as the injection guard** (`fl_ac_rules.h`, compiled into both targets). Not a copy: a layer with its own blocklist would be a second matcher that can disagree with the first. Every uncertainty — rules unreadable, malformed, enumeration failed, a truncated list — resolves to passthrough, which is the opposite polarity from the injection guard and the same principle: leave the host alone.
- Registered only while at least one Vulkan game has hooking enabled; unregistered on uninstall (Velopack hook) and when the last such game is disabled. **Never at install time** — `12_BUILD` §The Vulkan layer is not registered at install time.

### The enable-list

Referenced everywhere, specified nowhere until now (`20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §S4).
It is read inside a process we do not own, by code that runs before we know
anything, so its failure modes matter more than its format.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Location** | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FrameLedger\vklayer\enabled.txt` — per-user, no admin, same trust boundary as the rules copy |
| **Format** | UTF-8, LF, one lowercased process image name per line (`witchfire.exe`), `#` comments, blank lines ignored |
| **Bounds** | ≤ 64 KiB and ≤ 1024 entries. A file larger than that is treated as corrupt |
| **Matching** | Exact, case-insensitive, on the image name only — never a path, never a prefix, never a substring |
| **Sole writer** | The Agent. The layer only ever reads it |
| **ACL** | Inherited from `%LOCALAPPDATA%`: the current user's SID. **The Agent must not widen it** |

**Every failure is passthrough.** File missing, unreadable, oversized, malformed,
or the current process simply absent from it ⇒ the layer does nothing and
forwards. That is the opposite direction from the injection guard, and
deliberately so: here "do nothing" *is* the safe outcome, because the risk being
managed is our code running somewhere it was not invited.

Field notes — each of these was a defect in an earlier revision:

- **`dispatchRaysVolume` is `uint32`, and it is a volume, not a call count.** A
  single 3840×2160 primary-ray dispatch is 8,294,400 rays — 126× a `uint16`'s
  range, so a counter of that width saturates on every RT title at 1080p or
  above. That is precisely the regime `03_METRICS` §RT reads: its path-tracing
  heuristic keys off "rays dispatched per output pixel ≥ ~1.0", which is
  uncomputable from a pinned counter. `rays_per_pixel` divides this by output
  pixels.
- **`maxTraceRecursionDepth`** is the second of the four stated inputs to
  `pt_confidence`. It is read at `CreateStateObject` (§Hook inventory) but
  previously had no transport to the Agent and no column to land in.
- **`_pad0` and `_pad1` were explicit holes and are now carrying data.** Both were
  named only so every offset could be asserted; spending them costs nothing,
  because both bytes ranges were already inside the record and already written
  every frame. Neither needs a `FL_SHM_LAYOUT_VERSION` bump — and both had to be
  decided BEFORE a writer or a C# mirror exists, because after that the same
  change is user-visible: the Agent refuses to attach and tells the user to
  restart the game.
  - **`measuredMask` (@39)** distinguishes *"we looked and there was none"* from
    *"we did not look"*. The zero-defaults are affirmative negatives —
    `FL_UPSCALER_NONE`, `FL_FG_NONE`, `rtFlags = 0` — so a present-only writer
    with no feature hooks would otherwise assert "no upscaler, no FG, no ray
    tracing" as measured fact, 118 times a second, on the exact title chosen to
    prove ADR-7. `03_METRICS` would then produce `fg_factor 1.0`, the single
    inflated number CLAUDE.md rule 6 forbids, and map a whole session to a
    definite RT `No`, which rule 7 forbids.
  - **`swapchainId` (@60)** says which swapchain the present came through.
    Patching a vtable slot patches the SHARED `dxgi.dll` class vtable — measured
    across five configurations, D3D11 and D3D12, WARP and hardware, composition
    and HWND, all identical — so one hook sees every swapchain in the process. A
    title with a separate UI or video swapchain inflates `F_disp`, and
    `03_METRICS` has no way to tell the streams apart without this.
- **There is no `gpuBusyUs`.** Its only possible source is GPU timestamp queries
  injected into the game's command lists, which `15_ROADMAP` defers to v2 as
  "more invasive than anything in v1". A version-locked 64-byte record must not
  reserve space for a field v1 cannot fill; the bytes now carry
  `fgEvaluations`, which v1 genuinely produces.
- **`fgEvaluations`** is what makes Native-vs-Displayed computable at Tier 1 —
  see `03_METRICS` §Frame Generation.
- **`api` no longer lists `d3d9`.** D3D9 titles are almost entirely 32-bit and
  the Overlay is x64-only; they are Tier 2 in v1 — i.e. **unmeasured** (`20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §Scope).

- **SPSC lock-free ring**, capacity a power of two (default 8192 records = 512 KB), overwrite-oldest.
- Writer/reader seqlock protocol, including the rule that the payload write must
  **exclude** the `seq` field and that `seq` is never reset: `07_IPC` §Protocol rules.
- Header: three separate 64-byte lines before the ring — `FlShmHandshake` (write-once),
  `FlWriterState` (Overlay-written: `writeIndex`, `status`, `apiMask`, `faultCount`),
  and `FlControlBlock` (**Agent**-written: `pauseRequested`, `unhookRequested`,
  `overlayEnabled`, `guardTicks`). The control flags are *not* in the Overlay's
  header — they are written by the other process, and mixing them into an
  Overlay-written line reintroduces exactly the false sharing the split exists to
  prevent. Layout is normative in `07_IPC` §A + B.
- **The hot path performs: one QPC read, a few field reads from cached state, one 60-byte store, two relaxed atomic stores and two compiler fences.** No syscall, no allocation, no lock, no logging. Target ≤ 1 µs per present.
- Per-frame mutable state (current upscaler, render res, dispatch counts) lives in a small struct updated by the feature hooks and *read* by the present hook; counters reset at present.

## The watchdog thread — the only thread we add to the game

One thread, started on the init thread *after* the hooks are installed, sleeping
`1000 ms` at a time. It evaluates `unhookRequested` and the `guardTicks` deadline,
calls `StopObserving` when either fires, and **exits** once stopped.

**Why it exists.** Both stops used to be evaluated only on the present path, and
`MayObserve` is reachable only from `RecordPresent`, which is reachable only from
the two present hooks. In a process that had stopped presenting — hung,
alt-tabbed, sitting in a menu — neither check ever ran and the hooks stayed
patched in for the life of the process. `fl_shm.h` says over
`FL_GUARD_TICK_DEADLINE_MS`, in capitals, that the deadline must **not** be driven
by the present hook, *"because the clock would stop when presents stop, which is
the exact scenario this exists for"*. The code did what its own normative comment
forbade. Measured: `unhookRequested` set on a `hook-harness --hold` target left
`status` at `READY` indefinitely.

**It supplements the present path, it does not replace it.** `07_IPC` requires the
safety stop within one frame, and a one-second watchdog cannot promise that, so
the present path keeps its `unhookRequested` check. Same shape as §S6's
`LoadLibrary` hook supplementing the 30 s poll.

**Why a thread here, when `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §S2 rejected one for the Vulkan
layer.** All three of §S2's reasons are properties of the *layer*: the Vulkan
loader owns the layer's mapping, so a thread outliving it access-violates a host
we do not own; the re-scan it would have run allocates ~1.15 MB transiently; and
it would have called `NtQuerySystemInformation` and probed the SCM from inside a
game, which is the behavioural signature of anti-analysis code (CLAUDE.md rule 3).
None applies to the Overlay, which is loaded by documented `LoadLibraryW` and is
never `FreeLibrary`'d from a live process. **This thread enumerates nothing,
probes nothing and allocates nothing** — it reads two `uint32`s from our own
mapping and sleeps. That distinction is the whole justification and must survive
any future change: a watchdog that starts scanning is a different object under
rule 3.

Failing to create it is **not** fatal — the present-path checks still work, and an
Overlay that reacts only while presenting is strictly better than none. The
failure is recorded in `faultCount` so the Agent can see it rather than infer it.

`legal/DISCLAIMER.md` §2 discloses this thread to the user in plain language,
because "what runs inside the game" is exactly what that document exists to state.

## Fault policy

Every hook body is wrapped:

```cpp
#define FL_HOOK_GUARD(body, fallback)                    \
    __try { body }                                       \
    __except (FlFilter(GetExceptionCode())) { fallback }
```

- Any SEH exception inside our code ⇒ increment `faultCount`, record which hook, **return control to the original function** so the game continues.
- 3 faults total ⇒ set `status = self_disabled`, uninstall all hooks (`MH_DisableHook(MH_ALL_HOOKS)`), stop writing, stay dormant. The Agent sees the flag and finalizes the session as `degraded`.
- Never `__try` around the call to the original function — only around *our* code, so we never mask a game bug as ours or vice versa.
- The trampoline call to the original is always executed exactly once, on every path, including error paths.

## Unhooking

> **Built 2026-09-06 (P1 item 4) as compare-and-restore PER INLINE PATCH.** The Overlay swaps no vtable
> entries — every hook it installs is a MinHook inline patch on a function's first bytes — so the sentence
> below applies in its inline form: `StopObserving` walks a registry of every patch this DLL made (target,
> detour, name; filled by `PatchTarget` and the two direct sites) and calls `MH_DisableHook` on a target
> **only while the bytes there are still the jump MinHook wrote for us** — `fl_patch_check.h`
> `StillOurs`: `E9 rel32` → a `FF 25 00000000 <addr>` relay whose address is our detour, or the
> hot-patch `EB F9` form of the same. `MH_DisableHook(MH_ALL_HOOKS)`, which this replaced, wrote every
> saved prologue back without looking, and an overlay that patched the same function after us chains
> through our jump — that write would have removed their hook silently (§H7). A patch that is no longer
> ours is left in place, logged `UNHOOK_DECLINED`, and our detour stays in their chain forwarding (every
> body consults `g_observing`). Proven both directions against a real MinHook patch and a simulated
> foreign one in ctest `fl_unhook_inline` (the vtable form stays in `fl_unhook_preserves_foreign`), and
> against the injected Overlay in ctest `fl_guard` `[log]`, where every patch reads `UNHOOK_RESTORED`
> because the harness is alone in its process.

`FlRequestUnhook()` (or the control flag) ⇒ `MH_DisableHook(MH_ALL_HOOKS)`, restore vtable entries **only where they are still ours**, flush the ring, set status. **The DLL is not `FreeLibrary`'d from the live process** — a thread could still be inside a trampoline. It goes dormant and unloads with the process. This is deliberate and documented.

### Compare-and-restore, never unconditional restore

This section used to call vtable swapping a "cleaner uninstall" than inline
patching. **In the multi-overlay case that is backwards** (`20_OPEN_QUESTIONS`
§H7), and the multi-overlay case is the normal state of a gamer's machine — the
dev box alone has RTSS, OBS, Steam Overlay, Steam Fossilize, EOS and GOG Galaxy
resident (`spike-notes.md` §Environment).

If another overlay hooked the same slot *after* us, it saved **our detour** as
its original and chains through it. Writing the pristine address back then
removes their hook silently: their overlay stops working, with no error
anywhere, and we caused it.

So the rule is **compare-and-restore**:

```
if (slot != our_detour) -> leave it alone, go dormant
else                    -> restore the original
```

Re-check the comparison *under* the `VirtualProtect` write window, not only
before it. And when the slot has changed, going dormant costs nothing: we stay
loaded anyway, and our detour remains in someone else's chain doing nothing
harmful.

Verified by `hook-harness --probe-unhook` (ctest `fl_unhook_preserves_foreign`),
which simulates the foreign hooker rather than depending on RTSS being
installed, so it is deterministic and runs on CI. Both halves are asserted: we
decline when the slot changed, **and** we do restore when it did not — a
compare-and-restore that never restores is not a fix.

## Native logging

No logging in hook bodies. A small fixed-size in-memory ring of structured events (hook installed, symbol missing, fault, unhook) is flushed to `logs\overlay-<pid>-*.log` by the init thread at session end, on unhook, or on Agent request — never mid-frame.

> **Built 2026-09-06 (P1 item 4), as specified, with the details a bug report needs.** A ring of 256 ×
> 64-byte events (`qpc`, code, two operands, a 40-char name) appended with one `fetch_add` from init and
> watchdog paths and from a hook's **SEH handler** — `NoteFault` records the exception code and the hook's
> `__func__` — never from a hook body. Codes: `RING_CREATED`, `PRESENT_HOOKS`, `HOOK_INSTALLED` (one per
> patch, with the target address), `SYMBOL_MISSING` (once per pair, and only when the module IS mapped),
> `FAULT`, `STOP` (the reason), `UNHOOK_RESTORED` / `UNHOOK_DECLINED` (one per patch), `LOADER_DETOUR`,
> `SUPERVISION_LOST`. **Three flush points, none on a present path:** the end of `InitThread` (so the
> file exists from the start of the session and a crash mid-session still leaves it), the watchdog when
> `FlControlBlock.logFlushRequested` changes (a counter the Agent bumps at session end; nothing clears it),
> and the watchdog on its way out after any stop. Appended, never recreated; events overwritten before a
> flush are counted in a `#` line. Path: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FrameLedger\logs\overlay-<pid>-<yyyymmdd-hhmmss>.log`,
> resolved by `SHGetKnownFolderPath` (§S21's rule, not the environment). No allocation: static ring,
> static 64 KiB format buffer, static path. The CaptureHost prints the file and its `FAULT` / `STOP` /
> `UNHOOK_*` / `SYMBOL_MISSING` / `SUPERVISION_LOST` lines at the end of every session
> (`Consume/OverlayLog.cs`).

> **Tests and the real logs folder (2026-09-15).** The injection tests use the shipped Overlay, so their harness
> logs land in the user's real `logs\` too: measured that day, 2506 overlay logs, **2492 of them hook-harness's**,
> left by test runs since 2026-09-06, beside the owner's 14 from real titles. **The path stays not-a-parameter**: an
> environment variable or any other switch in the injected DLL would reopen the per-launch vector §S21 closed, and a
> test build of the Overlay would stop testing the binary that ships. Instead **each test binary removes what it
> caused** when its run ends: an `overlay-*.log` created after the run started whose first line names a hook-harness
> image that binary owns. Natively a Catch2 listener in `guard_test.cpp` over `src/native/tests/overlay_log_sweep.h` (the image
> must be this build's `FL_HARNESS_EXE`); in managed code `tests/Shared/HarnessOverlayLogSweep.cs`, an xUnit assembly
> fixture that `FrameLedger.DrainFixtures.targets` compiles into every test project staging the harness (the copy
> beside the test binary, plus directories a test registers — `PipeEndToEndTests` runs a renamed copy from its
> scratch directory). Test assemblies run in parallel with their own copies, so none removes a log another is about
> to read; a game's log names the game. **`tools/test-artifacts-check.ps1` makes a missing sweep red**: a harness log
> created during the gate and still there fails it. The logs from before this change are the owner's to delete.

## Test harness

`src/native/tools/hook-harness` — a minimal D3D11 app that presents at a controlled rate. It lets CI and local dev exercise hook paths with **no game and no anti-cheat surface at all** (`14_TESTING`).

Two choices make it run on a hosted CI runner, which is what made vtable-index
verification a dev-machine-only affair before:

- **WARP** (`D3D_DRIVER_TYPE_WARP`) — a software rasteriser, so no adapter is required.
- **`CreateSwapChainForComposition`** — no `HWND`, so no dependency on a window station or an interactive session.

Current modes: `--probe-vtable` (§H4, ctest `fl_vtable_indices`), `--probe-proxy` (§H5, ctest `fl_proxy_swapchain`), `--probe-unhook` (§H7, ctest `fl_unhook_preserves_foreign`), `--probe-cost` (NFR-1, measurement only), **`--probe-frames`** (ctest `fl_frame_identity` — what counts as a frame, against `GetLastPresentCount`), **`--probe-d3d12`** (ctest `fl_d3d12_acquisition` — device → command queue → swapchain), `--present N`, `--hold N`, **`--real`** and **`--plus-ui K``**, **`--vulkan --hold-presenting N`** (P1 item 3, real loader, exit 77 = cannot run here) and **`--opengl --hold-presenting N`** (P1 item 4, gdi32 `SwapBuffers` on a hidden window, Microsoft's generic renderer — runs on CI).

> **Every present here used to carry `DXGI_PRESENT_TEST`, which submits nothing.** Measured: 500 of them leave `GetLastPresentCount` at 0 while 37 real presents move it by 37. "N presents → N records" was therefore satisfiable only by a writer counting non-frames. `--real` issues real presents; the test-present path is kept as a named mode because it is what an alt-tabbed title actually runs.

Still to add as the hook layer grows: Vulkan devices, RT PSO creation and ray dispatch, stub upscaler exports with the real vendor names, a PSO-compile spike generator, and a fault-injecting hook body for the self-disable path (`14_TESTING` §Integration tests).
