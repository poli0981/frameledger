## Environment

Recorded 2026-08-02. Toolchain rows are **verified** — the native layer builds
and its tests pass on this machine. Everything below the toolchain is context
for the measurements that have not been taken yet.

**Coverage gaps to state plainly rather than discover later:**

- **No AMD or Intel GPU.** The `18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS` §Capability matrix cannot be
  filled for those vendors here, and that matrix drives what the UI advertises
  as available. Mark them "untested", never `?`. AFMF (§9) is likewise
  unreachable — it is an AMD driver-side feature.
- **No integrated GPU** (the `KF` suffix means no iGPU) and exactly one adapter.
  Multi-GPU adapter-LUID selection — the `adapterLuid` field in the shm
  handshake, and the PDH instance filtering in `18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS` §L1 — cannot
  be exercised on this machine.
- **240 Hz display.** Useful to know when reading the ring-sizing argument in
  `04_CAPTURE`: 8192 records is ~16 s at 500 fps, so ~34 s at this refresh rate.
  Hook-overhead runs should uncap the frame rate rather than sit at 240.

### ✅ This machine is a realistic multi-overlay test bed — use it

Six machine-wide implicit Vulkan layers are already registered under
`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Khronos\Vulkan\ImplicitLayers`:

| Layer | Source |
|---|---|
| `VK_LAYER_VALVE_steam_overlay`, `VK_LAYER_VALVE_steam_fossilize` | Steam |
| `VK_LAYER_EOS_Overlay` | Epic Online Services |
| `GalaxyOverlayVkLayer` (+ `_DEBUG`, `_VERBOSE`) | GOG Galaxy |
| `VK_LAYER_OBS_HOOK` | OBS Studio |
| `VK_LAYER_RTSS` | RivaTuner Statistics Server |

**RTSS and the Steam overlay also hook D3D presentation in-process.** That makes
this machine the right place to answer two open questions, rather than
discovering them in a user's bug report:

- **§H7 — unhook clobbering.** `17_HOOK_ENGINE` §Unhooking restores the original
  vtable entry. If RTSS hooked the same slot after us, restoring it silently
  removes *their* hook. Test: hook with RTSS running, unhook, confirm RTSS still
  works. The compare-and-restore-only-if-unchanged fix is testable here today.
- **§H5 — proxy swapchains.** With this many overlays present, the swapchain the
  game presents through may not be the object our dummy-vtable probe patched.

Two more observations from `vulkaninfo` on this machine:

- **`HKCU` implicit layers: none.** All six above needed admin to register.
  `17_HOOK_ENGINE`'s choice of `HKCU` is the less common one and the better one.
- The loader warns that `GalaxyOverlayVkLayer` violates naming policy
  `LLP_LAYER_3`, and that OBS/RTSS declare API 1.3 against a 1.4 application.
  Both are mistakes we should not copy — see `17_HOOK_ENGINE` §Vulkan, where the
  layer name was corrected to `VK_LAYER_FRAMELEDGER_overlay` as a result.

**GOG fixture available:** `A Space for the Unbound - Prologue` at
`D:\another\gog\`, with a `goggame-1125815775.info` sibling — a real fixture for
the `05_DETECTION` §Platform signatures GOG path.
