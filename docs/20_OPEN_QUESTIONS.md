# 20 — Open questions

Defects and gaps found by auditing docs `01`–`19` that **cannot be closed by
editing prose**. Each needs either an empirical answer from the P0 spike or a
design decision. `15_ROADMAP` names `docs/spike-notes.md` as where P0 writes the
answers; this file holds the questions.

Rules for this document:

- An item leaves this file only when it is **answered**, not when it is
  rephrased. The answer goes in the owning doc, and the entry here is deleted
  with a pointer in the commit message.
- Every S-series item is a **safety** item and blocks the first real injection.
- ~~Nothing here is a known bug in shipped code — there is no code yet.~~ **No
  longer true, and the change matters for how this file reads.** There is a built
  guard, a Vulkan layer, a rules seeder and 11 registered ctests, and §S21 records
  a fail-open found in *shipped* guard code. Entries here are now a mix of open
  questions and recorded defects.
- **A ✅ entry is closed.** They are kept rather than deleted, with their
  reasoning, so counting entries overstates the open work — read the markers.

## Scope decisions already taken (recorded, not open)

| # | Decision | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| — | **D3D9 is not a Tier-1 API in v1.** The Overlay is x64-only; an x64 DLL cannot load into a 32-bit process, and D3D9 titles are almost entirely 32-bit | **The consequence hardened on 2026-08-28 without a word of this row changing**, which is why it is called out: that catalogue used to be "Tier 2", meaning frame times without injection. Tier 2 now measures nothing, so those titles are **unmeasurable in v1**. The VN / JRPG / older-indie catalogue is Tier 2. Reversing this means a second 32-bit Overlay **and** injector, doubling the native build matrix and adding a second struct-mirror surface. Revisit only with evidence that users care more about those titles than about the maintenance cost |
| — | **`ci.yml` is repo-local**, not a caller stub | The ops repo's `reusable-desktop-csharp.yml` runs `dotnet` directly with no native pre-step input, and `12_BUILD` requires CI and local to run the same script |
| — | **No `v1 → v2` migration** | Nothing shipped, so no such database exists. `0001_init.sql` creates the current schema |
| — | ~~**Multi-process titles are refused as `TargetAmbiguous` in v1**~~ — **the Chromium case is RESOLVED the same day (2026-09-03), by the vendor's own label** | Chromium-based runtimes — NW.js, Electron, RPG Maker MV/MZ, a large share of the VN catalogue — run several processes from ONE image path (browser, renderer, GPU), and *Flower in Us* refused as `TargetAmbiguous`. The presenting process is Chromium's GPU process, which owns no window, so "the one with the window" and "the parent" were both wrong picks. **What resolves it:** Chromium marks that process with `--type=gpu-process` on its own command line. `TargetResolver` now reads each candidate's command line through `NtQueryInformationProcess(ProcessCommandLineInformation)` — **served by the kernel, no `ReadProcessMemory`, no PEB walk, `PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION` only**, which is the rule-4 line `HeldProcessHandle` already draws — and resolves only when **exactly one** readable candidate carries the flag as a whole argument. Two GPU processes (two instances), none, or any unreadable candidate still refuse. §S27 is untouched: consent is keyed on the path, every candidate is that path, the guard scans the pid chosen, and `--pid` stays forbidden. **Measured the same evening, and the first rule did not fire:** *Flower in Us* runs **six** processes — browser, `crashpad-handler`, three `utility`, `renderer` — and **no `--type=gpu-process` at all**. NW.js runs the GPU **in-process, in the browser**, which is the one process Chromium leaves untyped. Second rule added: exactly one untyped candidate, every other candidate typed, no GPU process ⇒ the browser is the target; two untyped candidates are two instances and refuse. The refusal line now prints the tree (`browser=1, renderer=1, utility=3, …`) so the next unknown shape is data rather than a bare `TargetAmbiguous`. **Still unmeasured:** whether the Overlay loads and sees presents inside that browser process |
| — | **Intel XeSS / XeFG identity is closed at the census — no hook on any `libxess*.dll` export** (decided 2026-09-04, delegated by the owner) | The XeSS SDK failed `18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS` §Checklist (Intel Simplified Software License: binary-only grant, no reverse engineering, termination; headers forbid copying), so no declaration may be vendored or re-declared. The signature-free counter that seemed to survive that — an assembly thunk on a named export — still inline-patches Intel's code inside the game process, which the same licence forbids as *modification*; it would also be the only entry outside `FL_HOOK_GUARD` and a second build language, for identity alone. An Intel title therefore reports upscaler `NOT_REPORTED` and, with `libxess_fg.dll` in the census, Presented FPS under rule 6's *"MAY include generated frames"* qualifier — honest, and the same answer NGX-direct got. **Reversal condition:** Intel relicenses the headers so the checklist clears; then §H11's AMD route applies to Intel verbatim |
| — | **A title whose upscaler or frame generation is compiled into its executable is Presented FPS + the census's qualifier, in attach mode, and that is the ceiling for IDENTITY** (recorded 2026-09-04; **two such titles found the same night — Rune Factory, and Black Myth: Wukong for its upscaling, which ships and loads the 1.1.x monolith and never dispatches to it**) | No module for the census, no export for the inventory: nothing by name. What survives static linking is behaviour on interfaces we hook — the FSR3 frame-generation proxy swapchain at *creation* (launch mode only, §S1 deferred) and queue-side cadence with no vendor name on it. ~~**No installed title has this shape**~~ — **Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma has it**: `amd_fidelityfx_dx12.dll` ships beside the executable and is never loaded (the census has no AMD module), FSR frame generation is on, and the report read `59.99 → 119.95 (×2 FG)`, *technology not identified* — because on a UE5 title **Streamline's frame token is requested whether or not NVIDIA's features are the ones running**, so the application-frame COUNT survives static linking even though the identity cannot. The ceiling is therefore lower than this row first said: the trio with an unidentified technology, not Presented FPS alone (§H11's run table). Identity for such a title stays out of reach by name |
| — | ~~**Tier 2 requires an elevated Agent**~~ | **CLOSED 2026-08-28 by the two-rung ladder.** The requirement came from Windows restricting ETW trace sessions; there is no ETW rung, so **no capture tier needs elevation**. Elevation is optional everywhere and buys exactly two things (CPU temperatures via PawnIO, attaching to elevated targets — ADR-9). An unelevated Agent whose Tier-1 attempt fails lands on Tier 2, which is what every unhooked session lands on regardless of privilege |

## S — Safety. Blocks the first real injection.

The project's central promise is that injection is opt-in per game, the guard is
a hard gate with **no override anywhere**, and no evasion is ever implemented.
Each item below is a place where the documents themselves leak a gap.

### S24 · The S-series ledger — read this before planning against the entries below

P0 exit criterion 2 (`spike-notes.md` §Exit criteria) is *"every S-series item
resolved, **or explicitly deferred with a written rationale**"*. That is not
auditable by reading 1,700 lines and counting ✅ marks — the markers are
load-bearing but they distinguish two states where the criterion needs four.
This table is the index; the entries remain the authority.

Added 2026-08-05. **Keep it current in the same PR that changes an item's state**,
or it becomes the next stale status claim this file exists to record.

> **The glyph legend, and it is the whole point of this table.** Unified 2026-08-27;
> before that, one disposition wore three marks and the criterion could not be audited
> by counting them, which is the only thing the table is for.

| Item | State | Note |
|---|---|---|
| S3, S5, S7, S8, S9, S10, S11, S15, S16, S17, S18, S21, S22 | ✅ **resolved** | Thirteen. Reasoning kept in place rather than deleted |
| **S25, S26** | ✅ **resolved 2026-08-05** | The two runtime stops unreachable in a non-presenting process; occlusion probes recorded as frames |
| **S28** | ✅ **resolved 2026-08-05** | The guard's entry points share process-wide statics; a concurrent call cleared the blocklist mid-match and every check fell through to `Allow`. Reproduced by CI, not argued |
| **S27** | ✅ **resolved, and restated 2026-08-06** | The chokepoint is the anti-cheat gate, not the consent gate. It was closed by *not building* a capture host; item 1 built one, and the ✅ survives on the clause that was always load-bearing — **no injecting entry point on any SHIPPED binary**. `FrameLedger.CaptureHost` is unpublished, and `tools/package-closure-check.ps1` makes that a gate rather than a fact about today's csproj. `HookRequest` is get-only behind one factory, so this entry's own rejected synthesis no longer compiles |
| S12 | 🅓 **deferred, rationale written** | Cautious mode → v1.1; it disabled nothing in v1. *(Marked ✅ until 2026-08-27 — same disposition, different glyph.)* |
| **S1** | ◐ **launch mode built as "inject late" 2026-09-06 (P1 item 2); the cost is now measured per title** | `FlGuardedInjectWhenReady` polls until a presentation runtime is mapped, then runs the full guard; `dxgiPresentsBeforeHook` and the reported wait are the input the 2026-08-05 deferral lacked. The ruling "inject late vs. no launch mode" is answered by construction — inject late exists — and whether it is *preferred* per title is what the numbers decide |
| **S13(c)** | ✅ **salvageable, and salvaged 2026-09-06** | The externally observable proxy the entry proposed is what was built; the missing input is produced by every launched session |
| **S19(b)** | 🅓 **deferred, rationale written — and MEASURED** | CI 2026-08-05: the fragment fires on `System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData.dll` loaded by a .NET **test host**, i.e. inside a real scan set in the launch-mode arrangement — refusing our own injection. The entry's "plausible and unmeasured" is superseded; the deferral rationale (a `CryptCATAdmin*` PR doing network I/O inside the hard gate, NFR-10) still stands. *(Marked 🔴 until 2026-08-27. The measurement belongs in this cell, not in the marker — a glyph that means "deferred" and a glyph that means "open defect" cannot be the same one in a table audited by counting.)* |
| **S14** | 🅓 **exe half wired 2026-08-05; store-id half deferred to P4, rationale written 2026-09-06** | The store-id half's only in-policy route is P4's platform metadata extractors feeding a guard-side resolver; a resolver with no extractor would refuse every title. No title is blocked by store id today because none is listed |
| **S23-1** | ✅ **resolved 2026-08-05** | `FlGuardBuildId` gives the Agent a build id of its own, and `ShmHandshakeValidator` performs the comparison `07_IPC` and `04_CAPTURE` both specify. Every refusal path is driven, including **both ids empty** — the shape the feature shipped in, where `"" == ""` reported `Ok` for every process on the machine |
| **S23-4** | ✅ **resolved 2026-08-05** | `19_SAFETY` §During a session said "the module scan and the driver scan"; `EvaluateImpl` runs four. Reworded to "every pre-injection check" so it cannot go stale when a check is added, with the two omissions named — `services` is the only tier measured firing on real anti-cheat, and the pre-scan is the only one touching the filesystem |
| **S2 part three** | ✅ **built 2026-09-06 (P1 item 3)** | In-layer supervision on the present path, landed with `vkQueuePresentKHR`; `unhookRequested` and the tick deadline both stop the layer (passthrough with the reason on the mapping), proven by a fake loader chain and a 1.5 s test-only flavour of the DLL |
| **S4 signing** | 🅓 **deferred to P4, rationale written 2026-09-06** | Signing is a property of the feed and there is no feed (§S20); every rules file today shipped inside a release whose checksum attests it. The P4 decision (compiled-in key, detached signature, fail-closed) is written in the entry |
| **S6** | ✅ **built 2026-09-06 (P1 item 1)** | The detour on `kernelbase!LoadLibraryExW` stops the Overlay from inside on an exact-floor MODULE match, within one present or one watchdog iteration, and wakes the lazy installers within milliseconds for an inventoried module; measured against the real Overlay in ctest `fl_guard` `[loader]`/`[S6]`. Exact names only — fragment and signer stay the host's 30 s scan, so the disclosure does not change |
| **S19(a)** | ✅ **resolved 2026-08-05** | `gameguard` could never fire — `guard` subsumed it. Removed; `rules-validate` now fails when any fragment contains another, so the class cannot return. Zero coverage lost: nProtect has its own named module family |
| **S19(c)** | ✅ **resolved 2026-09-06** | The fields are constants the schema pins and the guard never reads, because the policy is code by CLAUDE.md rule 2 and `19_SAFETY`; `rules-validate` now proves the schema rejects `action: "allow"` and `signerField: "CN"` (canary 3), so the data cannot say otherwise |
| **S19(d) residual** | ✅ **resolved 2026-08-05** | A second canary, **derived from the shipped document** rather than hand-written, carries `nameFragments: []` and must be rejected. The entry's stated consequence was overstated and is corrected in place: the generated floor would not have disappeared, `gen-ac-floor.ps1` hard-errors and the native build fails — what was unguarded is the *schema* half |
| **S20 feed half** | 🅓 **deferred to P4, rationale written 2026-09-06** | **FR-7.3 stays unmet and written as unmet**: the fetch needs a shipped Agent, §S4's signing and the privacy policy's rows, all P4; until then a rules edit ships with the next release, checksum-attested |
| **S23-3** | 🅓 **deferred to P3, rationale written 2026-09-06** | `08_UI`'s refusal notice is wrong in the commonest case; the requirement reaches `08_UI` and the `Safety_*` keys in the PR that creates the first refusal UI — a string with no view would read as done |
| **S23-5** | ✅ **resolved 2026-08-05** | Closed the way §S23-4 closed the same class — by **removing** the restatement, not correcting it — and `rules-validate` now fails when any `$comment` enumerates checks again. The rule's own first version was scoped to the wrong object and could not fire; it now walks every `$comment` and fails if it finds none |
| **S23-6** | ✅ **closed 2026-09-06** | `license-check` binds `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES` bidirectionally, and the accuracy blocks are now ONE text — `legal/ACCURACY.md`, embedded verbatim in `README.md` and `DISCLAIMER.md` §4, gated by `tools/accuracy-check.ps1` (self-tested both directions). Truth stays a human's job; drift between copies no longer is |
| **S23-2** | 🚫 **owner only — no PR can close it** | `Rules / validate` is **not** a required status check on `main`. **Re-verified against the live branch protection 2026-08-05**, not repeated from the entry: `required_status_checks.contexts` is exactly `["check", "analyze (csharp, none)", "analyze (cpp, manual)"]` (`strict: true`, `enforce_admins: true`, `required_linear_history: true`). The `validate` job is path-filtered and `pull_request`-only, so a red removal check does not block the merge button. **The gate that exists to make the anti-cheat blocklist un-removable is advisory.** This is a branch-protection setting |

| **S29** | 🅓 **six ✅ and one 🅓 on 2026-09-06 — nothing 🔴 remains** | (a) ✅ **closed 2026-09-06**: the managed drain is in the merge gate — §S19(b)'s signer half removed the refusal and `ci.yml` dropped `-SkipIntegration` in the same PR, both mechanisms at once, as the sharpening below said they had to be. *(History: ◐ CORRECTED — the honesty assertion *was* in the merge gate natively (`fl_guard`, 20.58 s on CI); only the **managed** drain was ungated, and §S19(b) was **not** a prerequisite of the feature hooks. Sharpened 2026-08-06: fixing §S19(b) alone would still have gated nothing, because `build.ps1`'s `-SkipIntegration` applied `--filter 'Category!=Integration'` before the guard was ever asked.)* (b) ✅ `fl_vtable_indices` now pins the Overlay's indices through a shared header; (c) ✅ **closed 2026-08-06 by deleting `ShouldUnhookAsync`** — zero production callers, strictly weaker than `ScanOnceAsync`, and inverted in polarity; the gate's public instance surface is now pinned to `{StartAsync}`; (d) 🅓 **deferred 2026-09-06 on a measurement** — `ci.yml` now prints a Vulkan runtime census, and the script runs as a CI step the day a runner has a loader; until then it stays hand-run before any layer PR, with the P1 Vulkan entry as the reminder (the pre-commitment in the entry covers both rows); (e) ✅ **closed 2026-08-06 host-side**, with a held process handle and a classifier that takes no elapsed-time parameter, so a frozen `writeIndex` can never end a session; (f) ✅ **closed 2026-08-20**: the normative contradiction between CLAUDE.md rule 7 and `03_METRICS` about inline RayQuery is settled the way the entry proposed — AS-build activity proves ray tracing is happening, *naming the technique* is what needs a DXIL scan — and rule 7 is amended in the PR that wrote the hooks. Its second half closes with it: `FL_MEASURED_RT` now has a producer (both command-list detours, installed off the game's own device), so all three conjuncts of the `No` branch are live and **`Yes` and `No` are both reachable for the first time**, proved by injection in both directions; (g) ✅ the present-only writer claimed `FL_MEASURED_OUTPUT_RES` unconditionally, including on records with no size |
| **S30** | ✅ **closed 2026-08-15** | Answered on the title that raised it: with Ray Reconstruction on, Cyberpunk 2077 evaluates `kFeatureDLSS_RR` on every application frame and `kFeatureDLSS` **not once**, so RR was doing the upscaling and the decode had no arm for it. Evidence rather than inference: `renderW/H` are published only on a frame that drained an evaluation and read 1485×835 = 0.58 × 2560×1440, so the scaling-input tag arrives ON the RR evaluation. Two further defects fell out — the pre-committed decision table had two holes, and the fix contaminated the census that found it (it derived the id from the decoded byte) |
| **S31** | ✅ **resolved 2026-09-04 — row P1, and `tokens/batch = 1.00`** | Is a drained Streamline batch an application frame? **Yes.** The `slGetNewFrameToken` count (#103, #105) reads 1.00 / 2.99 / 3.99 against Cyberpunk's own off / ×3 / ×4 and 4.00 on Hell Is Us, and on every leg with batches the two counts agree to the frame. Two independent per-frame API counts are the oracle four instruments could not be. `fg_factor` is published; `none` is reachable by counting. *(The row as it stood while open:)* ◐ **row P2, 2026-08-27 — the ORACLE is retired, the QUESTION is not** | Is a drained Streamline batch an application frame? The PresentMon 2.x `FrameType` test, with its decision table pre-committed BEFORE the run and `tools/frametype-oracle.ps1` producing the input as two dimensionless ratios. **Two obstacles measured before it could be run**: the console binary will not start a trace session unelevated on the dev box (exit 6; the account is in neither Administrators nor Performance Log Users, and the running shared service does not help), and `--track_frame_type` is a **beta** option whose own help says it needs application or driver instrumentation of the Intel-PresentMon provider — so it may be as unavailable as `fl-baseline-probe` proved to be. Two of the table's six rows retire it outright. Blocks HANDOFF item 3's producer decision |
| **H11** | ◐ **AMD ffx-api BUILT and RUN 2026-09-04 (A1–A3 accepted; the loader row added the same evening after three loader titles read silent); Intel closed at the census by licence; FSR 3.0 host route deferred to its own PR** | XeFG and FSR3-FG identity. The AMD half is measured on nine titles: the three ffx-api leaves AND the SDK 2.x loader are hooked (the loader turned out to be the game's entry on loader-shipping titles, with the leaves silent behind it), the vendored MIT headers (tag v2.3.0) decode the dispatch descriptor, and rows A1–A3 landed as pre-committed and **R6 closed on Dying Light: The Beast and KCD2 the same night** (`FSR (3.1 or 4 …)` / `FsrFg` / ×2 / 1.01 and `none` / 1.00 through the loader row). Wukong's FSR upscaling is compiled in (Rune Factory's shape; the title has no FSR frame generation), so nothing more is owed on the AMD half; the FSR 3.0 host route is the one deferred piece Intel's SDK failed the licence checklist, so XeSS/XeFG stay at the census (§Scope decisions). `ffx_fsr3_x64.dll` (FSR 3.0, Cyberpunk only here) ~~needs ten host headers from tag v1.1.4 and is deferred with that costing written~~ **built 2026-09-05** from tag `fsr3-v3.0.4` (the docs' `v1.1.4` was the wrong tag: twelve exports match 3.0.4, not 1.1.4's fifteen, and 1.1.4's descriptor appends fields after `renderSize`); one row, the host's UPSCALE; **rows B1–B4 owed** (below) |

~~**Six items are ❓ and one is 🚫.**~~ **Recounted 2026-08-05: TWELVE items block
exit criterion 2, not seven, and the undercount came from reading only the ❓ rows.**
The criterion is *"resolved, **or** explicitly deferred with a written rationale"* —
so ⏳ (open, sequenced) and ◐ (partly closed) are just as open as ❓, and each needs
either work or a rationale written down:

- ~~**six ❓**~~ ~~three ❓~~ ~~four ❓~~ **three ❓** — S6, S19(c), S20 feed half. ~~**S30**~~ ~~**S31**~~ *(S19(a),
  S19(d) residual and S23-5 resolved 2026-08-05, each by a mechanism rather than by a
  correction. **S30 closed 2026-08-15 and S31 opened 2026-08-20**, and this bullet went on
  naming S30 until 2026-08-27 — so the total below stayed right by coincidence rather than
  by count.)*
- **three ⏳** — S2 part three, S4 signing, S23-3
- ~~two ◐~~ ~~**three ◐**~~ **two ◐ (2026-09-04)** — S14, S23-6. ~~**S31**~~ *(moved out of ❓ on 2026-08-27 when its test landed on row P2; **resolved 2026-09-04** when the token count landed on row P1 with `tokens/batch = 1.00` — the question answered by a second count rather than by an oracle)*
- **one 🔴** — S29, added by the audit that produced this recount; **five of its seven
  findings are now closed**, and the residue is (a) the ungated managed drain and (d) the
  hand-run blast-radius script. *(This bullet listed **three** residues beside a count of
  five — five closed plus three open is eight, out of seven — because (f) closed on
  2026-08-20 and only the count was updated. The count was right and the list was wrong,
  which is the same shape as the ❓ bullet above. Corrected 2026-08-27.)*
- **plus 🚫 S23-2**, which no amount of code will do — the owner has to change a
  branch-protection setting.

~~**Nine, down from twelve.**~~ **TEN on 2026-08-15**, and it went UP — S30 is a defect a real-title run found, not a doc drift. Keep this list in the same PR that changes a row, or
the recount becomes the next thing that needs recounting.

~~**The markers themselves are part of the problem and should be unified.** One
disposition — *deferred, with a rationale written* — currently wears three glyphs:
S12 is `✅ deferred`, S1 and S13(c) are `🅓 deferred`, S19(b) is `🔴 deferred, but
now MEASURED`. This table exists so the criterion can be audited by *counting
markers*; three glyphs for one state defeats the only thing it is for.~~

**Unified 2026-08-27, and struck rather than deleted because the reasoning is the part that
generalises.** `🅓` is now the single mark for *deferred with a written rationale*: S12 moved
off `✅` and S19(b) off `🔴`, and the legend under §S24's heading states what every mark means
and whether it counts against exit criterion 2. **Neither move changes a disposition.**
S19(b) is as deferred, and as measured, as it was — its measurement lives in its note cell,
where it always did. What changed is that a marker no longer carries two meanings at once,
so the count and the glyphs can now disagree only if someone makes them.

### S26 ✅ · The ring counted occlusion probes as frames — **closed 2026-08-05**

`DXGI_PRESENT_TEST` runs the presentation test and **submits nothing**. The writer
recorded them like any other present, so a minimised or fully occluded game — which
issues them continuously — produced records that `03_METRICS` would have turned into
a frame rate it was not rendering, and into frame-time intervals that bound no frame.

**Who was responsible for filtering was assigned to nobody.** `07_IPC` did not say,
`03_METRICS:9` lists `presentFlags` among the consumed fields and is silent on this
value, and the harness's own history shows why that matters: every present in
`hook-harness` was once a probe, which made "N presents → N records" satisfiable
**only** by a writer that counts non-frames (`gates-that-cannot-fail`, #35).

**Decided: the writer drops them**, so the ring means one thing. The filter is placed
*after* the safety checks, so a probe-only process still evaluates the stop rather
than going unsupervised because it stopped drawing.

**Measured, both directions.** `hook-harness --hold-presenting 12` *without* `--real`
— a live, hooked, supervised target presenting nothing but probes — puts **142
records** in the ring against the pre-fix writer and **0** after. The test asserts
`status == READY` and `faultCount == 0` alongside the count, so "empty because we
unhooked" and "empty because we faulted" cannot pass for the right answer.

### S28 ✅ · The guard is not re-entrant, and nothing enforced that — **closed 2026-08-05**

Predicted by the drain design review, then **reproduced by CI** rather than argued.

`fl_guard_abi.h` states the one-at-a-time contract and three more comments in the
native tree repeat it. It was a comment, not a mechanism: `NativeAntiCheatGuard`
dispatched every call onto an arbitrary thread-pool thread, and `grep` for
`lock`/`SemaphoreSlim`/`Interlocked` over `Application` and `Infrastructure`
returned nothing.

**All four entry points share process-wide statics.** `ParseRules` keeps a
`static jsmntok_t toks[]` and is reached by `FlGuardEvaluate` and `FlGuardedInject`
through `LoadRules`, by `FlStaticPreScan`, and by `FlGuardCheckRules`.
`EvaluateImpl` additionally clears a function-scope `static Rules` on entry.

**Why that is a fail-open and not merely a race.** A second concurrent call clears
the blocklist while the first is matching against it — and an **empty blocklist
matches nothing**, so `CheckServices` iterates zero families, `CheckModules` and
`CheckDrivers` fall through, and `Evaluate` returns `Allow` from checks that looked
at nothing. `CheckModules` already refuses an empty *scan set* on the grounds that
it "must never read as clean"; the same rule had never been applied to an empty
*blocklist*.

**How it surfaced.** The drain integration test injects through the guard;
`RulesSeedingEndToEndTests` validates a document through `FlGuardCheckRules`; xUnit
runs test classes in parallel. The seeder test returned the wrong outcome. Two
callers, two entry points, one static — and neither test is about concurrency.

**Closed by a `static SemaphoreSlim(1,1)` in `NativeAntiCheatGuard`**, around every
native call including the synchronous `NativeCheckRules`. It goes in the facade
because that is the one place every native call passes through (§S15: one matcher,
not two), and it is `static` because the contract is a property of the loaded DLL
rather than of an instance.

### S29 · What the 2026-08-05 P0 completion audit found — five gates and one contradiction

A five-slice audit of the tree against the docs, with every claim re-checked by a
refuter told to default to *refuted*. The ledger drift it found is fixed in the PR
that records this. What follows is the residue: things that need code, recorded so
the next session finds them by reading.

**(a) ✅ The honesty contract is in the merge gate — natively, and since 2026-09-06 the MANAGED half too.**

> **Closed 2026-09-06 by §S19(b)'s signer half and the same PR's `ci.yml` change.** The .NET

> assertion catching a violation *"lives only in `ShmDrainIntegrationTests`, which

`measuredMask` and `rtFlags` are what stop a present-only writer asserting "no
upscaler, no frame generation, no ray tracing" as measured fact (CLAUDE.md rules 6
and 7). **The assertion exists in the NATIVE suite and CI runs it:**
`guard_test.cpp`'s *"the injected Overlay records real presents into the ring"*
injects into `hook-harness` and requires `measuredMask == FL_MEASURED_OUTPUT_RES`
and `rtFlags & FL_RT_NOT_MEASURED` on every drained record. It is ctest `fl_guard`,
and CI ran it in 20.58 s on 2026-08-05.

**Why the native path works where the managed one does not, which is the whole
shape of §S19(b):** `fl_guard_test.exe` is a *native* host. It never loads
`System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData.dll`, so the `protect` fragment never
fires and the guard does not refuse it. A .NET test host does, which is exactly why
`ShmDrainIntegrationTests` is skipped and this is not.

**What is genuinely not gated**, stated narrowly this time: the **managed** drain —
`ShmRingReader`, `ShmHandshakeValidator` against a live writer, and the
`PublishGuardResult` round trip. A regression there is caught by nothing automated.
Fixing §S19(b) buys that, and it is worth doing; it is **not** a prerequisite of the
feature hooks, and this entry should not be used to sequence them.

**(b) ✅ `ctest fl_vtable_indices` did not pin the Overlay's vtable indices — closed 2026-08-05.**
`hook-harness` declared `kPresentIndex = 8` / `kResizeBuffersIndex = 13` /
`kPresent1Index = 22` as its own literals, textually duplicated from the inline
values in `dllmain.cpp` with no shared header. Changing the Overlay's 8 to a 9 left
the ctest green: it proved a fact about `dxgi.dll`, not a fact about
`FrameLedger.Overlay`. The only test coupling the two is the integration class CI
skips — so in the merge gate the coupling was absent entirely.

**Closed by one header and an INTERFACE target.**
`FrameLedger.Overlay/include/fl_dxgi_vtable.h` holds the three slot numbers;
`fl_dxgi_vtable` lets `hook-harness` consume them without linking the DLL. Proven:
setting `kPresentIndex = 9` leaves the native build **green** and turns
`fl_vtable_indices` **red** (with three neighbouring harness tests, which depend on
hooking working). Restored: 16/16.

> **What this does not do:** the indices are still not *trusted* — the header is
> where the assumption is written once, and `--probe-vtable` calling each slot on a
> real swapchain is what makes it a measurement. It also does not license a

> index, not the address.
>
> P0 item 2's ✅ rests partly on "vtable indices proved by behaviour", and until now
> that proof did not reach the shipped values. It does now.

**(c) ✅ `HookedCaptureGate.ShouldUnhookAsync` — closed 2026-08-06 by DELETING it.**

Grep decided it: the only occurrences were the declaration and two tests. **Zero production
callers**, so removing it touched no shipping path. Its whole body was
`!(await _guard.EvaluateAsync(pid, ct)).IsAllowed` — strictly weaker than
`GuardSupervisor.ScanOnceAsync`, which additionally short-circuits on the latch, increments
`CompletedEvaluations` at one site on the far side of a returned verdict, latches
`UnhookRequested` and records `LastVerdict`. Routing it through the supervisor would have given
the gate per-session state on a class whose contract is that it "deliberately adds no judgement
of its own", for no new capability.

**The polarity trap was real and is worth recording**: `ShouldUnhookAsync` returning `true` meant
STOP, while `ScanOnceAsync` returning `true` means MAY CONTINUE. Two supervision APIs on adjacent
objects with inverted senses is a defect waiting for a hurried caller.

**Its two tests are replaced by one that is stronger.** They asserted the boolean and never the
tick or the latch — so they certified the API as sanctioned while saying nothing about what was
wrong with it, which is exactly how it came to read as sanctioned.
`TheGateExposesNoSecondInSessionRescanPath` pins the gate's public instance surface to exactly
`{StartAsync}`. Proven: re-adding the method leaves the build green and turns that Fact red.

> **The original entry follows, struck rather than deleted**, because "it is unit-tested, so it
> reads as sanctioned" is the observation that decided the disposition.

~~**(c) 🔴 `HookedCaptureGate.ShouldUnhookAsync` is a second in-session re-scan path**~~
that publishes no tick and does not latch — the two properties `GuardSupervisor`
and `fl_shm.h` §`guardTicks` spend paragraphs establishing as the point of the
design. It is unit-tested, so it reads as sanctioned, and it is the **more
discoverable** of the two APIs because a drain loop is already holding the gate. A
loop wired to it supervises the target while the Overlay's watchdog counts down to
a supervision-loss stop that never resets. Either route it through
`GuardSupervisor` or delete it; leaving both is how the counter quietly stops
meaning what it says.

**(d) ◐ `tools/vklayer-blastradius.ps1` case 3 could not fail — the assertion
half is closed, the regression-net half is not.** It printed in both branches and
never added to `$errors`. That is the only exercise of `enable_environment`, the
gate `15_ROADMAP` calls the highest blast radius in the spike — a passthrough bug
loads FrameLedger into every Vulkan process on the machine.

**It is now an assertion**: a non-matching value that enables the layer fails, and
says that `spike-notes` §2's measurement no longer holds. Being an observation was
*correct while the answer was unknown* — the step existed to discover the loader's
behaviour, and a discovery step that fails is just a step with an opinion. What
was wrong is that the discovery was made on 2026-08-02, recorded as settled, and
the step went on printing about it in green either way. **When a measurement
becomes a recorded fact, the step that produced it has to become the thing that
defends it**, or the fact stops being checked while a script that still mentions
it reads as coverage.

**Still open:** the script is excluded from `build.ps1` and CI by design (it
writes `HKCU`, and a CI runner is the wrong place to register machine-wide Vulkan
layers) and needs `vulkaninfo` on `PATH`. So the assertion only fires when someone
runs it by hand. Nothing reminds them, and a loader upgrade is exactly when it
would matter.

**(e) ✅ The reader cannot tell a dead target from a quiet one — closed 2026-08-06,
host-side, with no ABI change.**

The diagnosis stands and got worse on inspection. `ShmRingReader` holds the section
open, so a game that exits leaves `writeIndex` frozen and `status` `READY` —
byte-for-byte identical to a loading screen or an alt-tabbed window. `DllMain` handles
only `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH` and deliberately has no `DLL_PROCESS_DETACH` teardown
(`17_HOOK_ENGINE` §Unhooking), so **nothing is written on the way out**. And §S26
removed the accidental heartbeat: an occluded title used to emit a steady stream of
`DXGI_PRESENT_TEST` probes, and the writer now drops them, so an occluded game writes
*nothing at all*.

**The signal comes from the OS, not from the mapping.** `CaptureLoop` opens a process
handle **before** `FlGuardedInject` and holds it for the session. Held rather than
re-resolved, because pids recycle and the ring is named after one; the kernel will not
reuse a pid while a handle to it is open. `Infrastructure.Io.HeldProcessHandle` opens it
with `SYNCHRONIZE | PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION` — the narrowest rights that
answer the question, named explicitly as `05_DETECTION` asks, with no `VM_READ` and no
`VM_WRITE`, so CLAUDE.md rule 4 is untouched. Putting liveness on `ShmRingReader` was
rejected: it would make the *reader* open the target, which is new surface for nothing.

**`SessionEndClassifier` takes no elapsed-time parameter, and that absence IS the fix.**
A frozen `writeIndex` never ends a session, however long it has been frozen; a
"how long since the last record" parameter is precisely how this defect would come back.
Its test drives five simulated minutes of silence with `status` `READY` and asserts
`Running`.

**It also separates two stops the mapping cannot.** `StopObserving` stores
`FL_STATUS_UNHOOKED` for the safety stop *and* for supervision loss, so only the side
that caused one knows which — and `legal/DISCLAIMER.md` §2 discloses them differently
("the guard fired" against "contact was lost"). The classifier takes
`weLatchedTheUnhook` for exactly that reason.

**(f) ❓ CLAUDE.md rule 7 and `03_METRICS` §RT disagree about inline RayQuery, and
one of them is normative.** Rule 7 names *"inline RayQuery without DXIL scan"* as a
case where measurement is genuinely impossible and `N/A` is the only honest answer.
`03_METRICS:128` says the opposite in as many words: *"Hooking
`BuildRaytracingAccelerationStructure` is what makes inline ray tracing (DXR 1.1
`RayQuery`) detectable at all"*, and `README:14` promises it to users.

They are reconcilable — AS-build activity proves *ray tracing is happening* in a
RayQuery-only title, while *classifying* the technique as RayQuery is what needs a
DXIL scan — but neither document says so, and the two readings produce opposite
answers for the same title. **Whoever builds P0 item 6 has to settle this before
writing the hook**, because it decides whether a RayQuery-only title reports `Yes`
or `N/A`. Related, and worse: `03_METRICS` defines the tri-state's **`No`** branch
as *"RT-capable device present, no AS builds and no dispatches for the whole
session"* — and nothing measures device RT tier, ~~no record field carries it, and
every byte of the 64-byte record is allocated. **As the record stands, item 6 can
reach `Yes` or `N/A` and never `No`.**~~

**(g) ✅ The present-only writer claimed the one thing it may claim — unconditionally — closed 2026-08-05.**

`RecordPresent` set `FL_MEASURED_OUTPUT_RES` on every record, and two paths reach it
with no output size to report:

- `FindOrAdd` is a fixed 16-slot linear scan and returns `nullptr` once they are
  taken, so `outputW/H` are never assigned and stay 0.
- `GetDesc` failing, in `FindOrAdd` or in `ForgetChainSize` after a resize, leaves
  them 0.

So the record said **"output resolution MEASURED: 0 × 0"** — and `03_METRICS`
computes the upscale ratio as `sqrt((outW*outH)/(renW*renH))` from exactly those two
fields. This is the same defect #36 spent two bytes to fix, surviving inside the fix:
the mask distinguishes *looked* from *did not look* for six other fields, and for the
seventh it was a constant.

**Found by a design panel refuting a proposed layout, in the shipped writer rather
than in the proposal.**

Closed: the bit is set only when `outputW != 0 && outputH != 0`, which is what every
other bit in the mask already means.

**Proven both directions, and the second direction needed a new fixture.** Nothing in
`hook-harness` could reach the overflow branch — `--plus-ui` creates *one* extra
swapchain, which is a second stream, not an overflow. `--hold-presenting-overflow`

The existing end-to-end test asserts the mask is *exactly* `OUTPUT_RES` on a normal

the unconditional assignment turns the new test red with the build green.

### S30 ❓ · The record names the WRONG upscaler on a real title, and it is honest while being wrong

**Measured 2026-08-15, Cyberpunk 2077, and it is the first defect a real-title run
has produced** (`spike-notes.md` §8). The title is running DLSS. Every one of the
**2,461** params-carrying presents in a 40 s / 10,169-present capture decoded to
`FL_UPSCALER_UNKNOWN`.

`UNKNOWN` is the honest failure — `fl_shm.h` allows only `NONE` to be aggregated as
a negative, and the writer correctly never says `NONE`. But exit criterion 1 asks
for the **correct** upscaler, and `Unknown` is not it. **A wrong answer that cannot
be called a lie is still a wrong answer**, and it is the exact shape
`17_HOOK_ENGINE` calls the highest false-confidence risk in the spike, reached from
a direction nobody was watching: not a misspelt symbol, but a correctly-resolved
hook attributing the frame to the wrong feature.

**The mechanism, as far as the data shows.** `RecordPresent` drains `g_slSeen` with
`exchange(0)`, so a record is told about whichever Streamline features evaluated
since the *previous* present. Under multi-frame generation the app frame's
`kFeatureDLSS` evaluation and the presents that carry it are not one-to-one: 10,169
presents carried only 2,461 evaluation batches (×4.13, and the title's settings say
`DLSS_MultiFrameGeneration = x4`). The batches that reached a present held
`DLSS_G` / `DLSS_RR` / `OTHER` and not `kFeatureDLSS`, so the decode fell through to
`UNKNOWN`.

**What is NOT yet established, and must not be assumed while fixing it:**

- Whether `kFeatureDLSS` is evaluated at all in this title, or only `DLSS_G` and
  `DLSS_RR`. Cyberpunk ships `sl.dlss.dll`, so it *should* be — but "should" is what
  this ledger exists to distrust. The identity hook fires; **which** ids it sees was
  never printed.
- Whether the same happens without frame generation. One configuration was measured.
- Whether the fix belongs in the drain (accumulate identity across presents until an
  app frame boundary) or in the decode (prefer a super-resolution id over an FG id
  when several are seen). These produce different answers for a title that switches
  upscaler mid-session.

**Whose it is.** Item 3 restructures this exact drain — `g_slSeen` is a bitmask and
frame generation needs a **count** — so the fix lands there rather than as a
separate change that item 3 would immediately rewrite. **Do not "fix" it by making
the decode prefer DLSS without first measuring which ids arrive**: that would turn
a wrong answer into a confident wrong answer.

> ### The instrument is built. The decision table is below, and it is written BEFORE the run.
>
> **Why it is here rather than in the PR that acts on it.** "Measure, then fix" becomes
> "fix, then justify" the moment the table is written after the numbers are known — and
> nobody can tell the two apart afterwards, least of all the person who did it. So the
> mapping from measurement to action is committed first, in the file that owns the item,
> and the run that follows either lands on a row or does not.
>
> **What produces the input.** `FrameLedger.CaptureHost` now prints a Streamline id census
> (`SlCensus`) over the window the identity hook governs: how many presents drained a batch,
> and of those how many carried `kFeatureDLSS`, `kFeatureNIS`, `kFeatureDLSS_RR`,
> `kFeatureDLSS_G` and an **undecoded** id — the last of which is only separable because
> layout v3's `FL_FEAT_SL_UNDECODED` exists. It also prints `evaluations/batch`, which
> tests item 3's unverified premise with no oracle at all.
>
> | # | What the census says | What it means | The decode change |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | **O1** | `kFeatureDLSS = 0`, `kFeatureDLSS_G > 0`, `UNDECODED = 0` | the title does not route super-resolution through `slEvaluateFeature` at all | **none.** `UNKNOWN` is the true answer and the entry closes as "measured, not a defect". The upscaler fact then needs a different producer, which is its own item |
> | **O2** | `kFeatureDLSS > 0` on some batches, `0` on the batches that also carry `kFeatureDLSS_G` | identity and frame generation arrive in *different* batches | **drain**, not decode: accumulate identity across the presents of one application frame. Do NOT prefer DLSS in the decode — that gives the wrong answer for a title that switches upscaler mid-session, which is the whole reason these two options differ |
> | **O3** | `kFeatureDLSS > 0` on the SAME batches that carry `kFeatureDLSS_G`, yet the record still decoded `UNKNOWN` | the decode is losing an id it was handed | **decode.** The if/else-if chain assigns ONE bit per call and the last writer wins within a batch; make the mapping additive and re-check |
> | **O4** | `UNDECODED > 0` on the batches that decoded `UNKNOWN` | an id we do not map is arriving, and may be the super-resolution one under another name | **neither, yet.** Print the raw `sl::Feature` values before mapping anything — a new id decoded by guess is exactly this entry repeating. That needs a writer change of its own |
> | **O5** | `batches = 0`, or `evaluations/batch` far from 1 | the hook is not seeing what we think it sees | **stop.** Neither fix is safe: `evaluations/batch ≠ 1` falsifies item 3's premise outright and the FG factor is wrong by that factor, so that is the defect to chase first |
>
> ### THE x4 LEG, AND WHAT IT DID AND DID NOT SETTLE — 2026-08-16
>
> **The named rival is dead.** Read at x4, the overlay shows `DLSS 268 | FPS 67`,
> `272 | 68` and `260 | 65` across three instants. "Application frames" predicted the
> second field at ~65; "displayed divided by a fixed 2" predicted ~130. It reads 65-68.
> The prediction was written before the screenshots and it discriminated.
>
> Ratio against ratio, which needs no span and no shared window: ours
> `presents / batch` = 4.0000, the overlay's `DLSS / FPS` = 4.0000. At x2 both read
> 2.0000. Two instruments agreeing on a dimensionless quantity across two multipliers.
>
> **A SECOND CONCLUSION WAS DRAWN AND THEN WITHDRAWN, and the withdrawal is the useful
> part.** All five readings are EXACT integer ratios, which requires the true ratio to
> fall inside about +-1% every time. That looked like proof the overlay DERIVES one field
> from the other, because our own capture had measured an achieved factor of 1.84 rather
> than 2.00 — so the real factor seemed to vary while the overlay never did.
>
> **The 1.84 was ALT-TAB.** The operator switched away from the game during that capture.
> Frame generation stops while the title is unfocused, so the window mixed intervals at
> 2.00 with intervals near 1.00 and averaged 1.84. With that explained, the achieved factor
> is exactly N whenever the game has focus — and an INDEPENDENT counter would then also read
> exact integers every time. The evidence for "it derives" evaporates with its premise.
>
> **So the position is: "independent count" and "correct derivation" both survive, and no
> instrument available here can separate them** — each produces the true application rate
> whenever frame generation meets its configured multiplier, which is always, when focused.
> The premise that a drained Streamline batch equals an application frame is therefore
> CORROBORATED ACROSS TWO MULTIPLIERS AND NOT PROVEN.
>
> **The instrument that would settle it is already named in this repository.** PresentMon
> 2.x's `FrameType` classifies each present as application or generated from ETW, by a
> mechanism that divides by nothing. `15_ROADMAP` item 7 and `03_METRICS` rung 2 both
> pre-committed it, which is why they exist. That is the next measurement, not another
> reading of a present-hook overlay.
>
> ### AND THE ALT-TAB EXPOSED A REAL DEFECT, which is the finding with code attached
>
> `FgWindow` has a uniformity guard built for exactly this — split the window into buckets,
> refuse a factor when one bucket departs from the whole, because "averaging across a
> settings change is the classic way benchmark numbers become meaningless"
> (`03_METRICS`:133). **It cannot see this case.** `BucketsOf` sums `fgEvaluations`, which
> is zero on every record on this route, so every bucket is identical and the check passes
> vacuously. The 1.84 run is the proof: a real session where the number a consumer would
> publish was wrong by 8% and nothing in the report said so.
>
> **Consequences, and they are prerequisites rather than nice-to-haves.** If
> `presents / batch` is ever published as `fg_factor`, it needs a uniformity guard OF ITS
> OWN, keyed on the per-bucket `presents / batch` rather than on `fgEvaluations`. And a
> capture whose validity depends on the window being uniform should be able to say when it
> was not: focus loss is observable in-process, and an unfocused interval is not a
> measurement of the title's performance in any case.

> ### THE REPLACEMENT ORACLE DOES NOT SETTLE IT EITHER — corrected 2026-08-16, before it landed
>
> **A draft of this entry claimed the application-frame premise was measured. It was wrong on
> three counts and is recorded here rather than quietly deleted, because the draft read
> exactly like a result.** Steam's overlay, during a ×2 capture, showed `DLSS 162 | FPS 81`
> against a capture whose own numbers imply 161.7 and 80.8 — "0.2% on both".
>
> 1. **THE TWO AGREEMENTS ARE ONE, BY ALGEBRA.** `presents / batch` was 2.0000 exactly and
>    the overlay's own ratio is 162/81 = 2.0000 exactly, so `batches ÷ 81` and
>    `presents ÷ 162` are forced to the same residual — both −0.182%, to three digits. Two
>    independent checks essentially never do that. This is the defect `SlCensus.cs` was
>    corrected for **the same day** — one quantity read twice and cited as two witnesses —
>    reproduced in prose hours later. Fixing the code did not fix the habit.
> 2. **THE SURVIVING COMPARISON IS CIRCULAR.** The span was derived FROM `Displayed FPS`, so
>    `presents / span` is `Displayed FPS` restated. It compares our present count against
>    another present count. No step in the arithmetic touches an application frame.
> 3. **THE RIVAL HYPOTHESIS PREDICTS THE SAME NUMBER.** If the overlay's `FPS` field is
>    *displayed ÷ 2* rather than a count of application frames, then at ×2 the two are
>    numerically identical. The pre-registered prediction separated "application frames" from
>    "displayed frames" and never enumerated this one, so it was not a discriminating test —
>    and calling the result pre-registered borrowed credibility the design did not have.
>
> **And the oracle is not what the draft called it.** Steam's overlay is not "the game's own
> frame counter" and shares more with us than the draft claimed: `17_HOOK_ENGINE` §Coexistence
> records that RTSS and the Steam overlay **also hook D3D presentation in-process**. Which
> layer it counts at is unmeasured, and this title's present path has at least two — with the
> interposer engaged the swapchain the title holds is not an instance of the class whose
> vtable we patch (§H5). If Steam counts at the interposer's input, "FPS 81" is a present
> count one hook over, and equating it with an application frame is the same unverified step
> relocated.
>
> **THE DISCRIMINATING TEST, and it costs one screenshot.** Read the same overlay at **×4**:
> "application frames" predicts the `FPS` field reads ≈ 65 while "displayed ÷ fixed 2"
> predicts ≈ 130 — a factor of two apart. Then read it with **frame generation OFF**, where a
> genuine application counter converges with the displayed one and a fixed halving does not.
> **Compare RATIOS, not rates:** our `presents / batch` against the overlay's `DLSS / FPS`.
> Both are dimensionless and each is internal to one instrument, so neither needs a span —
> which also sidesteps the window defect below.
>
> **A code gap this exposed.** `FgWindow.Seconds` is computed and never printed, so the span
> over the window the batches were actually counted in cannot be read off a report at all.
> The draft reconstructed it from `Displayed FPS`, which spans a DIFFERENT window —
> `MeasuredFacts` runs from record 0 while `FgWindow` starts after the lazy-install prefix —
> and the resulting rate moves across 78.6–83 on window choice alone, ten times the residual
> the draft quoted. Print it unconditionally beside the other FG counts.

**The question HANDOFF item 3 cannot close without.** `presents / batch` reads
1.000 / 2.000 / 4.000 against Cyberpunk 2077's own off / ×2 / ×4, and a *batch* is
"a present that drained a Streamline evaluation", not an application frame. The two
coincide on that title only because Ray Reconstruction happens to be evaluated once
per application frame there. **Three oracles have been tried and all three fell** —
`fl-baseline-probe` by its own written falsifier, and two readings of Steam's
overlay, which §S30 records at length. PresentMon 2.x's `FrameType` was
pre-committed as the next measurement because it classifies each present from ETW
and divides by nothing.

**What produced the input** *(past tense: the tool was deleted on 2026-08-27 with PresentMon; kept here because the reasoning is why the run could be trusted).* `tools/frametype-oracle.ps1`, run against a PresentMon
2.x CSV and, optionally, a saved CaptureHost report. It compares **two dimensionless
ratios** — PresentMon's `displayed / application` against our `presents / batch` —
which is §S30's own correction applied: comparing *rates* needs a shared span, and
the span is where the previous draft went circular. Each ratio is internal to one
instrument, so neither side needs to know when the other started.

**The parser has never seen a real PresentMon CSV**, for obstacle 1. It resolves
columns by NAME, refuses loudly when `FrameType` is absent, prints the whole
`FrameType` vocabulary it saw rather than assuming one, and refuses rather than
dividing by zero when nothing is spelled `Application`. Its `-SelfTest` decision
table runs in `build.ps1 check` on every build, because that table is the only thing
standing behind an unvalidated parser.

scope, and — through `presents / batch` — whether `fg_factor` is ever publishable on a
Streamline title.

### S27 · The chokepoint is the ANTI-CHEAT gate, and it is not the consent gate

Found 2026-08-05 by an adversarial review of the drain host's design, before it was
built. Recorded because the design said `FlGuardedInject` "ONLY (the chokepoint)"
and read as though that covered the whole of CLAUDE.md rule 1. It does not.

`fl_guard_abi.h` says so in its own header: the ABI *"deliberately does NOT carry
per-game consent … This ABI enforces the ANTI-CHEAT gate — the part that protects
accounts — not the opt-in."* `fl_guard.h` adds `kHookNotEnabled` / `kConsentMissing`
/ `kPreviouslyBlocked` and states **"the guard itself never returns these"**. The
only producer is `HookedCaptureGate`, and its three inputs — `hook_enabled`,
`hook_consent_at`, `hook_blocked_reason` — come from a `games` table that **exists
in `06_DATA_MODEL` and in no `.cs` file**.

So the proposed `Agent --diag <pid>`, on a binary `12_BUILD` publishes
self-contained, would have loaded the Overlay into any x64 process a user named on
a command line: no game record, no consent stamp, no enablement, and the
`19_SAFETY` disclosure never shown. Rule 1's "never automatic", automatically. Not
an anti-cheat bypass — every anti-cheat check still runs — but a **consent and
disclosure gap in a shipped binary**, which is its own class.

**Two tempting fixes were rejected.**

- *Route it through `HookedCaptureGate` with `HookEnabled = true, ConsentedAt =
  UtcNow` synthesised.* It compiles. It is a gate whose verdict is decided before
  it looks — this file's signature defect, wearing the gate's own name.
- *Build it as a native `fl-session-probe` instead.* Strictly worse: a native tool
  structurally cannot read `games.hook_consent_at`, so the opt-in gate could not
  exist inside it at all, and it is then §S9's user-runnable injector renamed.

**What was built instead.** `ShmDrainIntegrationTests` — nothing packages it, and
the target is `hook-harness`, our own dummy D3D app built from this tree, carrying
no anti-cheat and belonging to no publisher. Injecting into it raises no consent
question: no game, no account, no terms of service. The test asserts that
constraint **on itself**, so it cannot grow into something that injects elsewhere
by increments.

~~**The real gate arrives with the `games` table, not before.** Until then there is
no injecting entry point on any shipped binary, and that is the correct state
rather than a missing feature.~~

### S25 ✅ · Both runtime stops were unreachable in a non-presenting process, and pause was unreachable on a ticking one — **closed 2026-08-05**

Found by tracing call paths while planning the next phase, in code merged the
same day (#43). Two defects, one root cause: **`MayObserve()` had exactly one
caller.** `RecordPresent` calls it, and only `Hook_Present` and `Hook_Present1`
call that. `Hook_ResizeBuffers` does not.

**(a) Neither stop fired in a process that had stopped presenting.** A game that
has hung, been alt-tabbed, or is sitting in a menu makes no present calls, so
`unhookRequested` was never read and the `guardTicks` deadline was never
evaluated. The hooks stayed patched in for the life of the process.

`fl_shm.h` states over `FL_GUARD_TICK_DEADLINE_MS`, in capitals, that this must
not be driven by the present hook — *"the clock would stop when presents stop,
which is the exact scenario this exists for — a game that has hung, or been
alt-tabbed, while anti-cheat loads behind it"* — and §S2 rejected a
present-driven re-scan for that reason a day earlier. **A normative comment
prescribing the opposite of the code beneath it**, which is the same shape as the
`MoveFileEx`/`ReplaceFileW` prescription §S21 records: a comment that names a
mechanism is a design somebody builds against.

Be precise about the exposure rather than overstating it: a process that is not
presenting is also not *recording*, so nothing false was written. What failed is
`19_SAFETY` §During a session's clean unhook on detection, and the promise
`legal/DISCLAIMER.md` §2 makes to the user in its own words.

**Measured, both directions.** `unhookRequested = 1` against a live injected
`hook-harness --hold` target (240 presents, then sleep): `status` stayed
`FL_STATUS_READY` through 10 s of polling. After the fix it reaches
`FL_STATUS_UNHOOKED`. ctest `fl_guard`, *"the safety stop fires in a target that
has STOPPED presenting"*.

**(b) `pauseRequested` was unreachable on any frame where `guardTicks` changed.**
The tick-freshness check sat between the safety stop and the pause check and
`return`ed `true` as soon as the tick differed from its cached value — so the
first present after every guard evaluation was recorded regardless of pause.

**Measured: 12 leaked records across 12 guard ticks, exactly one per tick**
(`writeIndex` 9 → 21 while paused). Each carries a `qpc` ~30 s after its
predecessor at the real re-scan cadence, which is a **fabricated 30-second frame
interval** in the series `03_METRICS` computes 1% and 0.1% lows from — the exact
artefact `07_IPC:114-119` forbids for torn records. Latent only because nothing
writes `pauseRequested` yet.

**Closed by a watchdog thread** (`17_HOOK_ENGINE` §The watchdog thread), which
takes the deadline off the present path entirely and thereby fixes (b) by
construction — there is no early return left to jump over the pause check. The
present path keeps its `unhookRequested` check, because `07_IPC` requires that
within one frame and a one-second watchdog cannot promise it. `StopObserving` is
now a compare-exchange, since two threads can reach it and `MH_DisableHook` must
run once; the **first** reason wins, so a self-disable is not overwritten by a
safety stop arriving a millisecond later.

**One thing this did NOT close, stated rather than left to look covered.** The
same trace found that `NoteFault` called `MH_DisableHook`, **discarded its return
value**, and stored `SELF_DISABLED` unconditionally — while setting no
`g_observing`, the flag whose own canary comment calls it *"the only thing that
holds if `MH_DisableHook` ever fails"*. That claim was true of the safety stop and
false of the fault policy. It is now routed through `StopObserving`, **but there
is still no fault-policy test at all**, so the fix has no regression net. The
vehicle is the blocker, not the assertions; `src/native/tests/CMakeLists.txt`
records both rejected approaches and why.

`04_CAPTURE` §Launch mode prefers `CreateProcess(CREATE_SUSPENDED)` → guard →
inject → `ResumeThread`. But a suspended process has **loaded no modules yet**,
so `EnumProcessModulesEx` returns essentially nothing and the primary
pre-injection check (`19_SAFETY` §Pre-injection checks item 1) is a no-op in the
*preferred* path. Anti-cheat that would have been caught in attach mode sails
through in launch mode.

**Proposed:** treat the static pre-scan and the driver scan as the gates that run
while suspended; resume, then re-run the module scan and only install hooks once
it passes and the first present is observed. This costs the early-init upscaler
data launch mode exists to capture — quantify that loss in P0 before accepting
it. Decide whether the answer is "inject late" or "no launch mode at all".

**Why the loss is still unquantified.** It needs a title that loads a
presentation runtime lazily. The local fixtures are `hook-harness` (creates D3D
at startup) and a 2D GOG prologue; a number from either would not generalise,
which is worse than recording it unmeasured. This is the one input §S13(c)
still lacks.

### S2 ✅ · The Vulkan layer has no guard — **both halves done; part three built 2026-09-06 (P1 item 3)**

An implicit layer is machine-wide and loads **before** anything of ours runs, so
the injection guard cannot cover it: no module scan, no driver scan, no
blocklist, no multiplayer heuristic. And `19_SAFETY` §During a session — "the
single most important runtime behavior in the whole capture layer" — is
Agent-driven and Overlay-targeted; with the Agent not running there is no
runtime guard inside a layered process at all.

**✅ Half one, done and measured** (`spike-notes.md` §2, `17_HOOK_ENGINE`
§Vulkan). `enable_environment` is in the manifest and verified against loader
1.4.357: with the variable unset, the loader locates the manifest and never maps
the DLL — and it compares the variable's *value*, so a stray `=0` does not
enable us. The cost is accepted: **Vulkan Tier 1 is now launch-mode-only.**
`tools/vklayer-blastradius.ps1` runs the check and unregisters in a `finally`.

**✅ Half two, done.** The layer scans its OWN process against the blocklist
at init and goes fully passthrough on any hit, using the SAME matcher and the
SAME rules file as the injection guard (`fl_ac_rules.h`, compiled into both). A
layer with its own blocklist would be a second matcher that can disagree with
the first, which is the defect the managed facade was built to avoid.

Every uncertainty resolves to inert: rules unreadable, malformed or incomplete,
module enumeration failed, a truncated list, a module that could not be named,
or an actual hit. That is the opposite *polarity* from the injection guard —
where an unknown means refuse to inject — but the same principle: do the thing
that leaves the host alone.

Verified by `fl-probe-vklayer` (ctest `fl_vklayer_selfscan`), which asserts
**both** directions — a clean process is *not* forced inert, and a process
carrying a planted module *is*. The planted module is our own DLL copied under a
blocklisted name, per `14_TESTING` §Integration tests; no real anti-cheat
software is shipped, downloaded or executed. Proven red by making the matcher
stop matching.

The probe installs the repository's seed rules to the product's one rules
location when nothing is there, and removes them afterwards. That is deliberate:
there is no way to point the layer at a different rules file (§S3), so without
it the test silently skipped on any machine that had not run the product — and a
ctest that always skips is a gate that cannot fail.

**The mechanism is decided.** The layer does NOT re-scan on its own after init.
Four options were pressure-tested (2026-08-02); the reasons the other three lost
are worth keeping, because each looks reasonable until costed:

- **A layer-owned worker thread** re-running the self-scan on a timer. Repeating
  a ~1.15 MB transient allocation and a full module enumeration every 30 s inside
  a game, against an 8 MB total budget — and, if the driver half were added,
  `NtQuerySystemInformation` plus SCM probing *from inside a game process*, which
  is the behavioural signature of anti-analysis code. CLAUDE.md rule 3 forbids
  hiding from anti-cheat; looking like the thing you are trying not to be
  mistaken for is the opposite failure. Also: the Vulkan loader owns the layer's
  mapping, and a thread outliving it is an access violation in a host we do not
  own — the same shape as the crash already measured in §S2.
- **Driving the re-scan from the present hook.** Rejected outright. It violates
  CLAUDE.md rule 5 structurally; it fails NFR-1 worst exactly where the user has
  least frame budget; and — decisively — **the clock stops when presents stop**,
  which is the scenario the requirement was written for. It would also inject a
  periodic stall into the frame-time series this product exists to measure.
- **Dropping Vulkan to Tier 2.** Not fatal to the product, but the stated form is
  false — ~~Tier 2 needs an elevated Agent~~ **and as of 2026-08-28 the premise is dead
  while the conclusion gets STRONGER: Tier 2 needs no elevation and measures nothing,
  so dropping Vulkan there is not a degradation, it is a removal.** For most users the real proposition
  is "duration and sensors only".

**What is decided:** supervision is the Agent's job, and a capture side that
cannot confirm supervision stops observing. That is the same polarity the rest of
the layer already has — every uncertainty resolves to inert.

**✅ The Agent half's counting discipline is built and proven.** `GuardSupervisor`
(`FrameLedger.Application`) computes what will become `guardTicks`, and the load-bearing property
is tested: **the tick counts completed evaluations, not seconds.** A timer-driven
heartbeat attests that the Agent *process* is alive while the guard loop can be
dead — a swallowed exception, a blocked service query, a stall on one unreadable
process in the §S16 scan set — and the capture side would then keep observing
*because* the thing supervising it had stopped. Seven tests force each of those.
`07_IPC` and `fl_shm.h` are corrected, and so is the polarity at the other end:
"the Overlay keeps writing (harmless)" on heartbeat loss described an
unsupervised hooked process as harmless.

**~~◐ The in-layer half is deliberately NOT built yet, and this stays open.~~ ✅ Built 2026-09-06, see the top of this part.**
The layer intercepts nothing — `vkQueuePresentKHR` is P1 — so a `ShouldObserve()`
today would be a predicate whose wrong answer *in either direction* changes
nothing observable. That is a gate on something that does not exist, which is the
defect class this file keeps recording. It lands in the PR that adds the present
hook, where a fake loader chain can drive it end to end. *(It did: `MayObserve()` in
`layer.cpp`, ctest `fl_vklayer` / `fl_vklayer_supervision`.)*

**Residual, to state rather than discover:** even once built, the mid-session
*driver* case is invisible from inside a layered process, and a layer cannot
leave a running game's loader chain — "stops" means passthrough, not unhook.
`legal/DISCLAIMER.md` and `README.md` now say so.

### S3 ✅ · `UpdateRules { path }` — **closed, and it was not alone**

Fixed in `07_IPC` §Messages, with the reasoning kept in a new §The pipe is not a
trust boundary so the conveniences are not reintroduced.

`UpdateRules` is now a bare trigger — the rules *source* is no longer a
parameter. Auditing the rest of the message table for the same shape found two
more, neither previously recorded:

- **`SetHookEnabled` took `consentAt` from the client.** The per-game informed
  consent FR-2.1 and `19_SAFETY` make the basis of every injection was
  client-asserted and forgeable. The Agent now stamps it.
- **`SetWatchlist` carried `hookEnabled` with no pre-scan**, while the adjacent
  `SetHookEnabled` re-scans and may reply `Refused` — and the UI re-sends the
  full watchlist on every connect, so a value forced once would be re-asserted
  forever. It now carries identity only.

The rule that generalises them, now written down: **no inbound message may
assert a safety fact.** It may request a state change; the Agent establishes the
fact itself.

### S4 ◐ · Trust model for the enable-list and the rules feed — **two of three closed**

**Enable-list: specified** (`17_HOOK_ENGINE` §The enable-list) — location,
format, bounds, exact case-insensitive image-name matching, sole writer, ACL,
and the rule that *every* failure is passthrough. Written down with it: the ACL
is not strong (anything running as the user can append a line), but a line there
only causes us to observe a Vulkan process, grants no injection, and cannot
disable the layer's own blocklist scan.

**Staleness: specified** (`05_DETECTION` §Trust and staleness of the rules feed)
— one read location, replace-only-if-valid with the last valid copy kept, and
staleness that *warns* and never disables. An expiry that weakens a gate is an
override with a timer on it.

**Signing: still open, and deliberately not dismissed.** HTTPS authenticates the
host, not the content. The rules above let a compromised feed be *rejected* but
not a genuine one *proven*. Residual risk, recorded rather than closed.

> #### 🅓 Deferred to P4, rationale written 2026-09-06

### S5 ✅ · `detection-rules.json` schema — **closed**

`rules/detection-rules.schema.json` (JSON Schema 2020-12) now fixes the shape,
and `tools/rules-validate.ps1` enforces it. The seed gained the representations
the `19_SAFETY` blocklist table needed and the abbreviated shape in
`05_DETECTION` could not express: `directories`, `services`, `files`, and a
`heuristic` block for the unknown-but-suspicious rule.

**`Test-Json` fails OPEN on a malformed schema** — measured on PowerShell 7.6.4,
`-Schema '{'` returns `$true` while writing a parse error to the error stream.
A truncated schema file would therefore make every rules file "valid", including
one with an empty blocklist. The validator now proves the schema is
*discriminating* before trusting it: a canary document that must fail is checked
first, and if the canary passes we refuse rather than report success.

Still imperative, because a schema cannot express them: required families still
present, no case-insensitive duplicate values, no prefix so short it would shadow
a system DLL.

**Two families remain unrepresented in the data** — Activision Ricochet (driver
and service names unconfirmed) and Valve VAC (needs `blockedStoreIds`). Recorded
in the seed's own `$comment`. The `heuristic.trustedSigners` list is a guess and
is marked UNVERIFIED.

A `CREATE_SUSPENDED` target has loaded almost nothing — **measured**: the module
scan does not merely come back thin, `EnumProcessModulesEx` *fails* with
`ERROR_PARTIAL_COPY` (§S1, `spike-notes.md` §1). The originally proposed "defer
hooks until first present" gate is also circular, because the ring handshake that
would signal first-present is published by the Overlay *after* injection.

An externally observable proxy is needed instead — e.g. resume, then poll until
the target has mapped a presentation runtime (`dxgi.dll` plus `d3d11`/`d3d12`, or
`opengl32`, or `vulkan-1`) *and* the scan passes *and* the blocklist is clean.
Decide whether that is acceptable, or whether launch-mode injection is dropped.

**The one input still missing** is how much early-init data injecting late
actually costs. It needs a title that loads a presentation runtime lazily; the
local fixtures (`hook-harness`, which creates D3D at startup, and a 2D GOG
prologue) cannot produce a figure that generalises.

### S15 ✅ · The four consequences of putting the guard in C++ (§S13(a)) — **closed**

Not questions — commitments the §S13(a) decision creates. **All four are done**,
each with the tests that keep it true listed below.

> **This section said "Three of four are done; item 1 is the one still open"
> while every one of its four bullets said DONE, item 1 included.** Corrected
> 2026-08-04. Recorded rather than silently fixed because it is this file's own
> recurring defect wearing a different costume: a status line whose verdict was

> 2026-08-04 next-phase review as open work.

- **1 — one matcher, not two: DONE.** `FrameLedger.Guard.dll` exposes a C ABI;
  `Infrastructure`'s `NativeAntiCheatGuard` is a thin P/Invoke facade over it,
  and `Application`'s `IAntiCheatGuard` exposes only the two questions the guard
  answers — no rules, no blocklist, no evidence. `04_CAPTURE` and
  `01_ARCHITECTURE` are corrected. Two tests keep it true: one asserts no
  managed type carries a blocklist token and the port accepts no evidence, the
  other asserts the managed `AntiCheatRefusalReason` has not drifted from
  `fl::guard::Reason` by reading every name back through the ABI.

  Three things that came out of building it:

  - **The guard DLL is loaded by absolute path**, via a
    `NativeLibrary.SetDllImportResolver`, and never by search. A planted
    `FrameLedger.Guard.dll` earlier on the probe order would replace the entire
    gate with whatever an attacker wanted it to say — a worse outcome than any
    other DLL-hijack in this application. CA5393 rejects `ApplicationDirectory`
    for exactly that reason, and no "safe" search path fits a DLL of our own,
    so the search path is not merely restricted but never consulted.
  - **A default-constructed `AntiCheatVerdict` must not read as permission.**
    The native `Verdict` gets a member initialiser; a C# struct zeroes every
    field and `Allow` is 0 — which it must stay, because it mirrors the native
    enum. The verdict therefore records whether it came from an evaluation at
    all: a value nobody assigned has evaluated nothing and permits nothing.
  - **`FrameLedger.Application` shadows `System.Windows.Application`** inside
    `FrameLedger.App`, because a sibling namespace beats a `using`. The WPF
    `App` class now says `System.Windows.Application` in full.
- **2 — Catch2: DONE.** `src/native/tests/guard_test.cpp`, ctest `fl_guard`.
  The seams are `fl::guard::Sources`, plain function pointers so the guard
  allocates nothing, and every failure in `14_TESTING`'s matrix is forced
  through a fake rather than hoped for.
- **3 — C++ JSON: DONE.** jsmn, pinned by commit. Chosen for what it does not
  do: no allocation, no exceptions, no recursion beyond a token array we own,
  and failure reported as a return code. Every parse failure is a REFUSE with a
  distinct reason.
- **4 — the override mechanism: DONE, and now enforced.** `14_TESTING` is
  rewritten, and `tools/chokepoint-check.ps1` fails the build if any translation
  unit other than the guard's names the injection primitive *or* the Win32 calls
  that constitute injection. Proven red both ways.

> **The injection primitive is now real**, in the order CLAUDE.md rule 2
> requires: the guard and its full matrix landed first, then the primitive.
> `VirtualAllocEx` + `WriteProcessMemory` + `CreateRemoteThread` on documented

1. **One matcher, not two.** `04_CAPTURE` §The guard writes
   `AntiCheatGuard.Check(pid)` and `01_ARCHITECTURE` draws the guard inside the
   Agent box, while `19_SAFETY` says "implemented in `FrameLedger.Injector` and
   re-checked by the Agent". The managed side must be documented as a **P/Invoke
   facade over the single native implementation**, living in `Infrastructure`
   (CLAUDE.md: the native layer is reachable only through `Infrastructure`). Two
   blocklist matchers that can disagree is a fail-open by construction.
2. **Catch2 is now a prerequisite, not a P1 nicety.** `14_TESTING` §Safety-guard
   tests requires forcing `EnumProcessModulesEx` failure, a partial module list
   and an unreadable process — all native tests now.
   `src/native/tests/CMakeLists.txt` still defers Catch2 to P1, and the guard
   needs seams (injectable enumerator function pointers) before those failures
   are forceable at all.
3. **The Injector must parse `detection-rules.json` in C++.** Record the parser
   choice, pinned by commit like MinHook, and the exceptions policy for that
   target — `-D_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=0` is Overlay-specific and the guard is *not* a
   hook path, so STL and allocation are fine there. Parse failure ⇒ **REFUSE**.
4. **`14_TESTING`'s absence-of-override mechanism must be rewritten.** It
   currently specifies a C# `sealed` token type that §S8 disproved by compiling.
   The replacement is (b) above plus a build-time check that no translation unit
   other than the guard's references the injection primitive.

### S16 ✅ · *Which* process does the guard scan? — **closed: the game's own subtree**

Decided 2026-08-02, specified in `19_SAFETY` §Pre-injection checks item 1.

**The injection target, its descendants, and its ancestors up to but excluding
the first known platform launcher.** Neither obvious reading survived: the
presenter alone misses a game launcher that initialises anti-cheat before
spawning the renderer, and unbounded ancestors would scan `steam.exe` — which
loads VAC modules — and so refuse every Steam title. A gate that refuses
everything is not a strict gate but a broken one, and it is how a user ends up
looking for the override CLAUDE.md rule 2 says does not exist.

A hit anywhere in the set refuses; a process in the set that cannot be inspected
refuses too. Sibling *services* are covered by name via the rules data rather
than by tree walking, which is more reliable. The runtime re-scan recomputes the
set rather than caching it.

<details><summary>The question as originally recorded</summary>

Found 2026-08-02. Not previously recorded anywhere, and it changes the guard's
own signature, so it belongs before the guard is written rather than after.

`04_CAPTURE` §The guard is `AntiCheatGuard.Check(pid)` — **singular**. But
`04_CAPTURE` §Process watcher says the capture target is "the descendant that
actually presents", elected from a ppid tree, and in attach mode elected only
after we see a ring handshake or count presents. So the guard is specified
against one pid while the subject of the capture is a *tree* whose presenting
member is identified later.

That matters because **anti-cheat frequently does not live in the presenting
process.** A launcher starts, loads the anti-cheat, and spawns the renderer as a
child; or a sibling service process holds it. Scanning only the elected
presenter would miss exactly that arrangement — and it is a common one, not an
exotic one.

**Needs a decision, and it is not obviously "scan everything":**

- Scanning the whole tree makes the guard stricter but raises the false-refusal
  rate, since a launcher may legitimately carry components a game process never
  loads.
- Scanning the presenter only is the narrow reading and is what the current
  signature implies.
- Whatever is chosen, the *machine-wide* driver check (check 2) already covers
  the worst case independently of process identity, which lowers the stakes but
  does not answer the question.

Also unspecified: what the guard does when the tree changes mid-session
(level-transition relaunches re-elect the presenting pid — `04_CAPTURE`
§Process watcher), and whether a newly appearing sibling is re-scanned.

</details>

### S17 ✅ · The schema accepted rules files the guard refuses to parse — **closed**

Found 2026-08-03 while scoping P0 item 3. Recorded rather than fixed silently,
because it was live in shipped artifacts and the shape recurs.

`rules/detection-rules.schema.json` and `fl_ac_rules.h` bounded the same things
with different numbers, and **the schema was looser in every case**. That matters
more than it sounds: an over-cap entry does not drop the entry. `ReadFamily`
returns false, `ParseRules` returns `kMalformed`, and `19_SAFETY` turns an
unparseable rules file into **REFUSE — for every title on the machine**. Rules
ship as updatable data pushed to every client and `tools/rules-validate.ps1`
validated against the *loose* schema, so a CI-green rules edit could have taken
the product out in the field.

| Bound | Schema said | Parser accepts |
|---|---|---|
| `blockedExecutables` / `blockedStoreIds` element | **object** | **bare string** — shape, not size |
| values per family | 64 | 16 (`kMaxValuesPerFamily`) |
| token length | 128 | 95 — `CopyToken` rejects at `len >= cap` |
| family name | 64 | 63, same off-by-one |
| prefix floor | 3 | 4 (`kMinPrefixLen`) |
| per-title arrays | 4096 | 256, now `kMaxTitleRules` |
| `nameFragments` / `trustedSigners` | 32 / 64 | 16 / 16, hardcoded |
| families across all five groups | 1280 | 64 (`kMaxFamilies`) |

**Proven, not argued:** a 17-value family passes the *old* schema (`exit 0`)
while making `ParseRules` return `kMalformed`; under the calibrated schema it
fails. Same input, both directions.

**The shape mismatch was the worst of them.** Both per-title arrays are objects
in the schema (`family`, `match`, `values`, `reason`) and were read by
`ReadStringArray` as bare strings. The first entry anyone added would either
overflow `kMaxValueLen` with its JSON text and refuse the whole file, or fit and
be stored as an unmatchable blob. Only the two empty arrays kept that theoretical.
The parser now reads the objects and composes `store` + `id` into the joined
`"steam:730"` form `fl_ac_rules.h` always promised.

Closed by: calibrating the schema to the parser, deriving nothing by hand
(`tools/rules-validate.ps1` reads the thresholds out of the header by regex and
**fails rather than skips** if it cannot, and ctest `fl_rules_budget` generates
its boundary cases from the same constants). That ctest also asserts something
nothing asserted before — **that the rules file we actually ship parses in the
guard at all.** Every case in `guard_test.cpp` parses an inline fixture.

**Two things this turned up that are not the schema's fault:**

- **A `static_assert` that could not fire on the change it existed to catch.**
  `fl_guard_abi.cpp` pinned `kRulesIncomplete == 16` to protect
  `FlGuardReasonCount() == 17` — but `kRulesIncomplete` was the *last*
  enumerator, so appending a `Reason` left it at 16, the assert passed, the
  exported count stayed stale, and the managed mirror test iterated 0–16 and
  never compared the new value. Replaced with a `Reason::kCount` sentinel the
  count is derived from. Verified: appending a reason now moves the count to 18
  and `GuardMirrorTests` fails with a precise message.
- **`ReasonName`'s exhaustiveness was not compiler-enforced, though a comment
  said it was.** Omitting `default:` does *not* make MSVC object: C4061/C4062 are
  off by default even at `/W4`, measured by appending an enumerator with no case
  and watching `/W4 /WX` build clean. That is a gate that existed only in prose.
  It is now ctest `fl_guard`'s "every Reason has a distinct name", proven red.

### S18 ✅ · The guard refuses itself — **closed 2026-08-04**

Found 2026-08-03 during the first real injection (`spike-notes.md` §7), and
isolated on one title with everything else held constant:

| Evaluating process | Verdict |
|---|---|
| An **ancestor** of the game, with `FrameLedger.Guard.dll` loaded | `SuspiciousUnsigned`, signal `FrameLedger.Guard.dll` |
| Not an ancestor | `Allow` |

§S16 walks the game's ancestors up to the first platform launcher. The name
`FrameLedger.Guard.dll` contains **`guard`**, one of the heuristic's
`nameFragments`; the signer half is deliberately unwired, so an unchecked
signature is untrusted by definition (`fl_guard.cpp`, "that is the correct
direction") and fragment-plus-untrusted refuses. In launch mode the Agent is the
game's parent (`04_CAPTURE` §Launch mode) and hosts that exact DLL. Same shape as
the `EasyAntiCheat_EOS` service defect: **a gate that cannot pass is not strict,
it is broken.**

**Not fixable by signing.** The project ships unsigned — CLAUDE.md rule 9 and the
pinned-stack Packaging row. (§S18 and `spike-notes.md` §7 previously cited
`12_BUILD` §Packaging for this; that section contains no signing text. Citation

#### The decision — identity by **install root**, heuristic tier only

Taken 2026-08-03 after a four-lens panel, three adversarial refuters and a
completeness critic. **All three refuters refuted the panel's own first answer**;
what follows is what survived.

Suppress **only** the `sawSuspicious` fragment tier, **only** for a scan-set
process whose image path resolves under FrameLedger's own install directory, and
**never** for the injection target. Everything else in `CheckModules` is
untouched: the exact blocklist (`st.hit`) still returns first, `kFailed` still
gives `kProcessUnreadable`, `kIncomplete` still gives `kModuleScanFailed`. The
ancestor walk keeps climbing **past** us rather than stopping at us.

Why install root and not the three obvious alternatives:

- **Not by module name** (the original option 1). `HasSuspiciousFragment` is
  called for every process in the scan set, so a name allowlist suppresses that
  name *inside the game too* — and it is spoofable by a DLL that borrows the name.
- **Not by `GetCurrentProcessId()`** (the panel's first answer). It identifies
  the process *executing* the guard; the defect is a property of the **binary**.
  `FrameLedger.App` also carries `FrameLedger.Guard.dll` — `Infrastructure.csproj`
  copies it to "everything that references it", and FR-2.2's pre-launch question
  loads it in the UI process. A second FrameLedger process in the ancestor chain
  refuses exactly as before. This is what the third refuter broke, correctly.
- **Not by stopping the ancestor walk at us**, the way `IsPlatformLauncher` stops
  it at `steam.exe`. That boundary is justified because everything above
  `steam.exe` is shared platform infrastructure that legitimately loads VAC.
  Everything above the Agent is an *undefined* category — a shell, an IDE,
  Playnite — so truncating there deletes processes we merely did not want to
  think about. That is "could not look" recorded as "looked and it was clean",
  which this file exists to prevent. Skipping one process and continuing costs
  the same and is strictly more conservative.

Install root has the trust base the other three lack: an attacker who can place
a binary inside our install directory can already replace `FrameLedger.Guard.dll`
itself, which `NativeAntiCheatGuard.cs:48` calls a worse outcome than any other
DLL-hijack in the application. It also costs one `QueryFullProcessImageNameW` per
scanned pid — the call `ImageDirectoryImpl` already makes for check 4 — and it
covers `FrameLedger.exe`, `FrameLedger.Agent.exe` and every future FrameLedger
process for free. "Could not read the path" refuses, as everywhere else.

**Explicitly rejected, with the reason, so nobody re-proposes them:**

- **Re-parenting the launched game** (`PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS`) so
  we are never an ancestor. This is lineage spoofing: anti-cheat reads parent
  lineage precisely to see who started the game. CLAUDE.md rule 3 — rejected on
  principle before merit. Recorded because it is the clever answer someone
  proposes next.
- **Running the fragment tier on the target subtree only, never on ancestors.**
  Attack cost zero: ship the anti-cheat in the launcher under a name not in
  `modules`. It deletes coverage for exactly the arrangement §S16 was written to
  catch.
- **Deleting the `protect` fragment** to cure the false positive in §S19 below.
  It is a detection removal in a hard gate, on the mode that ships. See §S19.
- **Deferral alone** — "attach mode only, launch mode deferred". Correct as a
  scope statement, not an answer: §S19 shows the same code path refuses
  *attach*-mode titles.

#### Why this is worth more than it looked

The old text said §S18 blocks "the early-init upscaler data §S1/§S13(c) are
about". That understated it. **§S18 is the sole blocker of the entire Vulkan
Tier-1 path.** The layer is gated by `enable_environment`
(`FRAMELEDGER_ENABLE_VK_LAYER=1`), which only the process that *starts* the game
can set — `17_HOOK_ENGINE:161` states this makes Vulkan Tier 1 launch-mode-only.
And §S1 does **not** apply there: the Vulkan path performs no injection, so there
is no suspended target and no `ERROR_PARTIAL_COPY`. "Launch mode is blocked by
§S1 anyway" is therefore false for an entire Tier-1 API family.

#### ✅ Closed 2026-08-04 — implemented, and all three blockers answered

1. **The test vehicle exists, and it is not the one this entry asked for.**
   ~~`fl_guard_test` calls `SystemSources().ProcessIsOurOwn` directly~~ — **that seam was deleted by §S22(b)**; the live test is now "§S22(b) — the real ModuleIsOurOwn answers both directions" and calls `SystemSources().ModuleIsOurOwn`, both
   directions: this process (which runs the guard code from its own directory)
   is ours; a freshly spawned `System32\cmd.exe` is not. That tests the
   *predicate* against a real machine, which is what the exception rests on —
   loading `FrameLedger.Guard.dll` into the test just to make a module NAME
   appear would have proved the fragment matcher, which `fl_guard` already
   covers, and would have exercised the boundary logic not at all.
2. **The two-pid case is a fixture, and the thing that blocked it was the FAKE.**
   `FakeEnumModules` ignored its pid, so "two distinct FrameLedger processes,
   both carrying the DLL" could not be written down. With a per-pid map it is
   seven lines. That was ~10 lines of test-side code standing in front of a
   safety item for a day.
3. **Ratified: the Agent is the sole host.** `05_DETECTION` and `07_IPC` already
   assigned it ownership of `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FrameLedger`; the guard DLL now ships
   only to `FrameLedger.Agent` (and to `Infrastructure.Tests`, which P/Invokes
   it), via `/FrameLedger.Guard.targets` instead of a `None` item in
   `Infrastructure.csproj` that flowed to every referencing project.

Six fail-closed cases hold the exception narrow, and each was proven red against
a specific plausible mistake — dropping the target exclusion (`guard_test.cpp:516`),
suppressing regardless of the tri-state (`:527`), and an implementation that calls
every process ours (`:612`).

**Measured on three real titles, not only in fixtures** (`spike-notes.md` §7). A
stand-in for the Agent, built into the Agent's own output directory beside a real
`FrameLedger.Guard.dll`, loads it and launches the game — so our binary is the
game's ancestor and carries the offending module name. Deadly Heart Gambit, Lies
of P and Alan Wake 2 all go `SuspiciousUnsigned` → **`Allow`**. Evaluate only;
`FlGuardedInject` was never called.

That measurement also validated the assumption the fix rests on and the unit
tests structurally cannot reach: **the Agent's executable and the guard DLL land
in the same directory**, which is what makes "equality, not containment" the right
comparison. `12_BUILD` publishes both executables into one `out/app`, so the
shipped shape matches.

### S19 · The unknown-but-suspicious heuristic has five defects of its own

Found 2026-08-03 by the §S18 panel and **re-measured by hand before recording**,
because three of them change what a shipped gate does. They are separate from
§S18 — no self-exclusion touches any of them.

> **Heading said "four" over a body running (a) to (e).** (e) was appended
> without updating the count. Corrected 2026-08-04, along with the claim that (b)

**(a) ✅ `gameguard` could never fire — closed 2026-08-05.**
`HasSuspiciousFragment` is case-insensitive `IContains`, and `"gameguard"`
**contains** `"guard"`. With both in the list, the `guard` fragment matched
everything `gameguard` would, first. A shipped rule incapable of firing
independently — the file's own recurring defect, sitting inside the safety gate.

**Closed by deleting the entry, and by a rule that stops the class returning.**
`rules-validate` now fails when any `nameFragment` contains another, naming which
one can never fire and why. Proven both directions: re-adding `gameguard` goes
red at a named line; the shipped list is green.

**Why deletion was the safe option here and is not, elsewhere.** The standing
objection to removing a fragment — it is a detection removal in a hard gate — is
correct for `protect` and does not apply to this one. Subsumption means *by
construction* that no module name loses coverage: anything `gameguard` matched,
`guard` matches. And it was redundant twice over, which nobody had checked:
nProtect GameGuard has its **own named module family** in the same file
(`GameGuard`, `npgg`, `GameMon`, exact-prefix), so the fuzzy tier was never its
only route.

**The hazard this closes was always in the future, and that is why "cosmetic" was
the wrong word for it.** With both entries present, someone removing `guard`
leaves a list that still appears to cover nProtect. Now the list is minimal, so
removing `guard` is visibly a removal.

> Removing it trips `rules-publish`'s `$removed = old − new` check. **That is the
> gate working**, not an obstacle: it exists to make a blocklist removal
> reviewable, and this is one.

**(b) `protect` produces measured false refusals, and they are not hypothetical.**
Unelevated, Windows 11 26300, **331 processes, 0 access-denied, 4 hits, none
anti-cheat**:

| Process | Module matching `protect` |
|---|---|
| `WhatsApp.Root` | `mskeyprotect.dll` — *Microsoft Key Protection Provider*, 10.0.26100.1746, `C:\WINDOWS\system32\` |
| `WidgetService` | `mskeyprotect.dll` |
| `ProtonVPN.Client` | `System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData.dll` |
| `Malwarebytes` | `Malwarebytes.Protection.Interop.dll` |

**The fix is not to delete the fragment** — that is a detection removal in a hard
gate, and `antitamper`/`protect` is the only tier covering families the seed
admits it has no data for (Ricochet, VAC). Three refuters agreed.

**(c) `signerField` and `action` are required by the schema and parsed by
nobody.** Both are `required` in `detection-rules.schema.json`, both carry
safety-relevant `$comment`s — `action` "is a const, not an enum, so `allow` and
`warn` are unrepresentable" — and neither appears anywhere in `fl_ac_rules.cpp`.
The heuristic's policy is hardcoded at `fl_guard.cpp:293`. So the
**warn-and-refuse** behaviour `19_SAFETY` §Blocklist seed describes is not
configurable and never was; the field that would express it has no consumer.

**(d) ◐ The fragment list has unreconciled copies — more than three. The runtime
hole is CLOSED.** `rules/detection-rules.json`, `guard_test.cpp` (the inline
`GoodRulesJson()` fixture) and `rules_budget_test.cpp` each carry their own, and
re-counting on 2026-08-04 found two the entry had missed: the prose in
`19_SAFETY` §Heuristic tier, and a `$comment` in `detection-rules.schema.json`
that restates the **four-fragment** version — the exact staleness §S19(e) was
raised about, sitting in the schema that gates the data. The generated floor is
not a copy: it is derived at build time and cannot drift.
`ParseRules` guards the entire heuristic read behind `heurTok >= 0` and
`IsCompleteEnoughToGate` never looks at fragments, so a rules file with no
`heuristic` block parses `kOk` and the tier silently stops existing.

**(e) ✅ Closed — the normative doc was already fixed, and this entry was the
stale one.** It claimed `19_SAFETY` lists four fragments. As of commit `bb0da0a`
— the same commit that recorded §S19 — `19_SAFETY:281` lists all five, and the
lines beneath it carry a correction block covering the fragment count, the
`gameguard` subsumption and the unread `action` field.

What survives is not a doc error but a missing gate: **nothing prevents the drift
recurring.** `rules-validate.ps1`'s doc/data cross-check parses only the
§Blocklist seed *table*, so the fragment sentence is invisible to it. That check
is worth extending; the claim that the doc is wrong is not.

### S20 ◐ · Delivering the rules file — **seed half done, feed half open**

The guard reads its blocklist from one place under Local AppData, and until
2026-08-04 nothing in this repository ever wrote a file there. On any machine that
had not hand-installed one the guard answered `RulesUnreadable` for every title —
correct fail-closed behaviour, and also the whole story: the first real
injection's opening refusal was exactly this.

> **The entry's own opening sentence was not quite true**, and the exception
> matters for anyone reading it as a survey. `fl-probe-vklayer` DOES seed the
> file — install-only-if-absent, path resolved through `fl::guard::RulesFilePath`
> — and then deletes what it installed. So the repository had a writer; it had no
> *product* writer, and a ctest that removes its own work leaves the machine
> exactly as it found it.

**✅ The seed half is built.** `rules/detection-rules.json` now ships in the
Agent's output (`FrameLedger.Rules.targets`), and `RulesSeeder` installs it to the
product location. The Agent is the sole writer, per §S18's ratification, and it is
a real caller rather than a component nothing invokes: `Program.cs` runs it and
reports the outcome.

Measured end to end on this machine — remove the file, the guard answers
`RulesUnreadable`; run the Agent; the guard reads its rules and reaches check 1.

Four decisions worth keeping, each of which replaced something the design review
disproved:

- **Provenance, not `rulesVersion`.** The first design replaced the installed file
  when the packaged seed was strictly newer. Measured against this repository's
  own history, every commit that changed the `anticheat` block left `rulesVersion`
  untouched and the one commit that bumped it changed the block not at all — so
  the rule would have delivered **none** of the changes it existed for. The seeder
  records a hash of what it installed instead.
- **`ReplaceFileW`, not `MoveFileEx`.** See §S21: the prescribed primitive returns
  `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` against a live reader. `ReplaceFileW`'s backup parameter
  also makes `05_DETECTION`'s "the last valid copy is kept" a mechanism rather
  than a sentence.
- **Validated by the guard's own parser.** `FlGuardCheckRules` is a new
  observation-only export, because `DetectionRulesFile` never reads the
  `anticheat` block (§S15) — validating with it would have checked everything
  except the half the hard gate consumes, and could have installed a document the
  guard then refuses for every title while reporting success.
- **A usable file we did not write is left alone.** Safe only because §S21's floor
  is now generated from the shipped blocklist: a rules file can ADD and cannot
  remove. Under the narrow floor the same rule would have handed permanent control
  of the blocklist to whoever created the file first.

#### What is still open, and it is not small

- **The feed half.** `05_DETECTION` §Trust and staleness specifies an HTTPS fetch
  with validate-then-replace; none of it exists. So **FR-7.3 is unmet**: anti-cheat
  entries cannot reach a machine on their own schedule, only with a release. A
  rules edit still changes nothing on any installed machine until the next build.

  > **🅓 Deferred to P4, rationale written 2026-09-06.** The feed is the product's one
  > permitted outbound request after the release check (CLAUDE.md rule 8), and it needs
  > three things P0 does not have: a shipped Agent to run it in, the signing §S4 defers to
  > the same phase, and the privacy policy's rows that describe it (`legal/PRIVACY_POLICY.md`
  > already flags them as describing a request the software does not make). Until then a
  > rules edit reaches a machine with the next release, whose checksum attests it — a slower
  > delivery, not a weaker gate. FR-7.3 stays unmet and stays written as unmet.
- **No binary/data handshake inside the guard.** `ParseRules` still walks only the
  `anticheat` subtree and never reads `schemaVersion` or `rulesVersion`. Teaching
  it to refuse an unknown version would be a second machine-wide refusal lever
  pulled by data, and `rules-publish.yml` gates neither field — see `13_CI_CD`,
  which used to claim a bump check that does not exist.
- **`trustedSigners` is the one allow-widening field a foreign file still
  controls.** Deliberately not floored, because flooring an allowlist has the
  wrong polarity. Inert today — `IsTrustedSigner` has no production call site
  while §S19(b) is deferred — and **live the moment the signer half is wired**,
  which makes gating it a prerequisite of §S19(b) rather than of this item.
- **This is what arms the Vulkan layer's self-scan for the first time.** `layer.cpp`
  §S2's second half could only ever answer "inert" while the file never existed.
  It is now reachable, on a machine where the file is present. The layer still
  intercepts nothing (`vkQueuePresentKHR` is P1), so nothing observable changes
  yet — recorded here so it is not discovered as a surprise when the present hook
  lands.
- **A seed replacement is a rules update in FR-2.3's sense**, and the obligation
  attached to that event — re-run the pre-scan, force-disable a game that has
  started matching — is unimplemented. There is no `games` table yet, so there is
  nothing to write; named here so whoever builds persistence has an anchor.

### S21 ✅ · The hard gate's data source was caller-nameable, and its completeness floor never read the values — **closed**

Found 2026-08-04 by an adversarial review over the next-phase option set, and it
outranked every item that review was convened to sequence. Recorded in full
because it is the first *fail-open* found in the guard since `EnumDeviceDrivers`,
and because both halves passed every gate in the repository.

Two facts that were individually defensible and jointly an override:

| | |
|---|---|
| `RulesFilePath` built the path from `_dupenv_s(&base, &len, "LOCALAPPDATA")` | The CRT environment is **inherited**. In launch mode the guard's host is started by a shortcut, a `.bat`, or `04_CAPTURE:60`'s Steam launch-option wrapper — all of which choose that variable |
| `IsCompleteEnoughToGate` checked three family **names** in the right **groups** | It never read `values`. "Is this shaped like a blocklist" was standing in for "is this a blocklist" |

So a twelve-line rules file naming `Easy Anti-Cheat`/modules, `BattlEye`/modules
and `Riot Vanguard`/drivers with junk values parsed `kOk`, matched nothing, and
`Evaluate` returned `Allow` on a machine running Vanguard. **No admin, no write
to our install directory, nothing left on disk.** That is the override CLAUDE.md
rule 2 says does not exist.

`05_DETECTION:75-77` asserted the source "is not a parameter and cannot be
redirected". True of the pipe — §S3 closed that — and false of the environment,
which nobody re-asked. **When a doc says an input cannot be redirected, the
question is "through which channel", and the answer has to enumerate the rest.**

**Fixed by the floor, not by the path.** `fl::guard::FloorFamilies` carries the
blocklist inside the binary; `ParseRules` seeds it before reading a byte and
nothing merges, rewrites or removes it. §S8's mechanism applied to data: a family
data cannot remove cannot be bypassed. Path resolution moved to
`SHGetKnownFolderPath` as well, and that is written down as a **narrowing, not a
guarantee** — a user can still move their own Local AppData; what is gone is the
per-launch vector.

Kept able to fail: the completeness check now runs over the **file's** families
only. Running it over the merged set would have retired a real refusal by
accident, since the floor satisfies it by construction — a gate that cannot fail,
arrived at while fixing a different bug.

**A second, independent total failure in the same six lines.** The path was ANSI
(`char[MAX_PATH]`, `CreateFileA`), so a profile directory the system code page
cannot spell became a path containing `?`, and the guard refused **every title
for that user, permanently**, naming no cause. Measured 2026-08-04, system ACP
**1252**:

```
C:\Users\田中\AppData\Local    ->  C:\Users\??\AppData\Local
C:\Users\Nguyễn\AppData\Local  ->  C:\Users\Nguy?n\AppData\Local
```

Note what that measurement says and does not say. The trigger is the **system**
code page, not the user's language — a Japanese install (ACP 932) spells 田中 and
still mangles Nguyễn. So the honest form is "broken for any user whose profile
path the machine's ACP cannot represent", which the `ja`/`vi` shipping locales
make likely and which an ASCII profile can never expose. Now `wchar_t` +
`CreateFileW` throughout, including the Vulkan layer's enable-list, which had the
same defect and would have made Vulkan Tier 1 silently never work for those users.

**Three resolvers became one.** The guard, the Vulkan layer's enable-list and
`fl-probe-vklayer` each resolved Local AppData their own way, and
`DetectionRulesFile` made a fourth on the managed side while its own comment
claimed to reach "the same directory the native guard uses". `fl_ac_rules.h`
calls this "the ONE location" and says a second reader would be "a second
blocklist by accident" — there were four. `FlGuardRulesFilePath` now exports the
guard's answer for **observation only** (no setter, no path parameter), and
`RulesPathAgreementTests` asserts the managed resolution matches it. That
assertion matters most for §S20: a seeder writing where the gate does not read
reports success, and its own test would agree with it.

Sharing mode unified too — all readers now `FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE |
FILE_SHARE_DELETE`. The guard denied delete sharing and the layer denied nothing.

Proven red before being called done. Two of the four canaries named here were
rewritten when the floor became generated — `kFloorFamilyCount` no longer exists
and no floor value can be hand-pointed — so the current set is: a generator that
drops four of the five groups, a floor keeping one of five fragments, a
`kMaxFamilies` below twice the seed, and a `kMaxNameFragments` below twice its
fragments. Emptying `FloorFamilies` still makes the disarmed-rules test allow, and
running the completeness check from index 0 still lets a file with no BattlEye
through.

#### Measured end to end, not only in fixtures (2026-08-04)

- **The override, on two real binaries.** Same input to both: a rules file naming
  the three required families with junk values, and a real
  `EasyAntiCheat_x64.dll` loaded in the target. `bb0da0a` → **`Allow`**; after
  the floor → **`BlockedModule`, family `Easy Anti-Cheat`**. The pre-fix half took
  the crafted file through an inherited `LOCALAPPDATA`; the post-fix half had to
  place it at the real path, because the environment no longer selects it.
- **The ANSI half, on the real Win32 calls.** System ACP 1252. A rules file
  written into `…\田中\AppData\Local\…` and `…\Nguyễn\AppData\Local\…` exists on
  disk and `CreateFileW` opens it; **`CreateFileA` fails with
  `ERROR_INVALID_NAME (123)`**. The same file under an ASCII profile opens both
  ways — which is precisely why a dev box cannot see this.

#### Two residuals, measured rather than asserted

- **The known-folder path is still user-relocatable, and that was the claim.**
  `HKCU\…\Explorer\User Shell Folders\Local AppData` matches what the API returns,
  and the key is `FullControl` for the current user with no elevation. So the
  wording in `05_DETECTION` holds exactly as written: this removes the
  **per-launch, per-process** vector, not every redirection. Deliberately not
  tested by repointing it — that would change the machine's shell configuration
  for every application.
- **The Vulkan layer gained two DLL dependencies, and it is mapped machine-wide.**
  `dumpbin /dependents`: `KERNEL32` → `KERNEL32, ole32, SHELL32`. Measured
  residency across 189 inspectable processes: shell32 **62%**, ole32 **61%** — so
  for roughly a third of processes these are genuinely new. The exposure is
  narrower than that number suggests, because `enable_environment` means the
  layer only *maps* into processes the Agent launched (§S2), and a game is far
  more likely than a browser to have both already. Recorded rather than waved
  away; delay-loading would not help, since the layer resolves the path at init.

### S22 ✅ · The guard gated the TARGET and nothing gated the PAYLOAD — **both halves closed**

Found 2026-08-04 by a completeness critic over the next-phase plan, in code that
had been merged for days and passed every gate in the repository. Recorded in
full because it is the second *fail-open* found in the guard, and because the
reason it stayed invisible is instructive: every reader, every doc and every
review framed the guard as a gate whose subject is **the process we are entering**.
Nobody asked what we were putting there.

#### (a) ✅ Any DLL, into any process without anti-cheat — **closed**

`FlGuardedInject(targetPid, dllPath, out)` is an exported C ABI on the shipped
`FrameLedger.Guard.dll`. Between that boundary and `CreateRemoteThread` the only
thing ever asked of `dllPath` was `GetFileAttributesW` — *exists, and is not a
directory*. Measured through the shipped DLL with no test seam:
`C:\Windows\System32\winmm.dll` into a live process, verdict `reason=0 (Allow)`,
module present afterwards.

That is **§S9's user-runnable injector**, which this project refused to ship,
re-shipped as a documented export with a published calling convention. §S9's own
reasoning names the hazard exactly and then stops one step short — it rejected a
standalone injector as "a path into a game process **that the guard did not stand
in front of**", and `fl_guard_abi.h` concluded "there is no entry point here that
skips a check". Both true, and both about the target.

Note what the shape is, because it is this file's recurring one: not a wrong
assertion, a **missing** one, behind a scope sentence that reads as though it
covered everything. Every existing test passed `FL_OVERLAY_DLL` as the payload,
and the one negative case used a *missing* path — so the whole matrix exercised
"is there a file there" and nothing exercised "whose file is it".

**Closed by a new seam and a new reason.** `Sources::PayloadIsOurOwn` resolves
the payload — through symlinks, 8.3 names and junctions, via
`GetFinalPathNameByHandleW` — and requires its directory to be the one the
guard's own code was loaded from, compared by file id. Equality, not containment,
reusing §S18's `OwnDirectory`/`SameDirectory`, which until now existed only to
*relax* this gate. A null seam, a seam that cannot answer, and "not ours" are one
outcome: `Reason::kPayloadNotOurs`.

**What it does NOT cover, with the boundary stated rather than implied:**

- It is not proof the payload is `FrameLedger.Overlay.dll`. It is proof of
  **where the bytes live**. Anyone who can write to that directory can already
  replace `FrameLedger.Guard.dll` itself — the same trust base §S18 rests on, and
  the project ships unsigned (CLAUDE.md rule 9), so there is no integrity check on
  that directory's contents.
- It is not atomic with the load. The remote `LoadLibraryW` re-resolves the path,
  so a file swapped between check and call is not caught. Same trust base again.
- **Absent** and **foreign** are kept distinct on purpose: a damaged install and a
  misuse of the ABI need opposite responses, so a path naming no file still
  returns `kInjectionFailed`. The existence test therefore runs *before* the
  identity test — otherwise "not ours" absorbs "not there", since the identity
  seam works by opening the file. Caught by the pre-existing test that asserts
  exactly this distinction.

**A layout bug came with it, and it had to be fixed in the same change or the
gate could not pass.** Nothing in this repository copied `FrameLedger.Overlay.dll`
anywhere. The native build left it in `FrameLedger.Overlay/` while the guard
built into `FrameLedger.Injector/`, and `dotnet publish` produced an `out/app`
with the Agent, the guard and the rules seed **but no payload at all**. Invisible
while the Agent had no injector control; it would have surfaced as an
unexplained `kPayloadNotOurs` the first time one was wired.
`FrameLedger.Overlay.targets` now ships it beside the Agent, and
`src/native/tests` stages its own copy beside `fl_guard_test` — where the guard
is compiled *into* the test binary, so "the guard's directory" is the test's.

Proven red **and** green, and proven to recover: three canaries (the refusal
removed, a seam failure treated as ours, a null seam allowed through) each turn
`fl_guard` red. The green direction is asserted separately, because a gate that
refuses every payload carries as much information as one that accepts every
payload — the staged Overlay must be accepted, the *same file staged elsewhere*
must not, and the test refuses to run at all if those two paths ever resolve to
one directory.

#### (b) ✅ The §S18 exemption asked about the PROCESS, not the module — **closed**

Same probe, same binary, same target; only the caller's directory differs:

| Caller's location | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Beside `FrameLedger.Guard.dll` | `Allow` |
| Anywhere else | `SuspiciousUnsigned`, family `unknown`, signal `FrameLedger.Guard.dll` |

`SuppressFragmentTier` delegates to `ProcessIsOurOwn`, which compares the
scan-set **process image** directory to `OwnDirectory()`. The module that matched
is *our own guard DLL* — it contains the fragment `guard` — but the exemption
never asks about it. So any FrameLedger-family host that does not sit beside the
guard poisons its own scan set. The Agent works by accident:
`FrameLedger.Guard.targets` copies the DLL beside `FrameLedger.Agent.exe`.

This matters now rather than in the abstract, because every throwaway
inject-host proposal puts the tool in its own build directory — the arrangement
measured RED — and a launch-mode host is by construction in the §S16 scan set.
Whoever hits it will read the refusal as the fuzzy tier being over-eager (§S19
says so, in writing) and go rewriting a safety gate instead of moving a file.

**The right fix is to key the exemption on the MATCHED MODULE** — a scan-set
process is exempt when the module that tripped the fragment tier is ours by file
id. Strictly narrower than today's process-level exemption, and it fixes launch
mode. It also removes a real over-reach nobody had costed: today a genuinely
foreign suspicious module loaded into a FrameLedger process — an AppInit DLL, an
AV user-mode hook, an IME — is suppressed along with our own.

**Done, and it was not the size the plan assumed.** `NameSink` was
`bool(*)(void*, const char*)` fed by `GetModuleBaseNameA`, so the module's path
never reached the decision point — the constraint §S19(b) already recorded. What
it actually took:

- **A new sink type.** `ModuleSink` carries `(name, path)`; `EnumerateModules`
  takes it, drivers keep `NameSink`. `GetModuleFileNameExW` failing is **not**
  `kIncomplete` — the base name is what the blocklist matches on, so the scan is
  complete in the sense that matters. What is lost is only the ability to
  *exempt*, and a null path is treated as "not ours". The failure narrows what we
  allow rather than widening it.
- **The restructure §S19(b) predicted.** `NameSinkFn` latched the FIRST
  fragment-matching module and skipped the fragment test for every module after
  it. Harmless while any hit refused, because the latched name only had to be *a*
  reason. Per-module suppression turns it into a **fail-open reachable by load
  order**: our guard DLL matches first, is exempted, and a genuinely suspicious
  module loaded afterwards is never recorded. `ModuleSinkFn` therefore skips an
  exempt module and **keeps looking**, latching the first non-ours one — and
  still does not stop, because an exact blocklist hit later in the same process
  outranks the fuzzy tier.
- **`ProcessIsOurOwn` is gone**, along with its implementation. A seam nothing
  calls is dead weight, and keeping both forms would be two answers to one
  question.
- **One implementation, two seams.** `ModuleIsOurOwn` and `PayloadIsOurOwn` ask
  the identical question and `SystemSources()` wires both to `FileIsOurOwnImpl`.
  They are separate *pointers* only so the matrix can force each failure
  independently; a live test asserts the two pointers are equal, so a future
  divergence fails rather than quietly becoming a second matcher (§S15 item 1).

The module form is also **strictly narrower**, which nobody had costed: a
genuinely foreign suspicious module loaded into a FrameLedger process — an
AppInit DLL, an AV user-mode hook, an IME — used to be suppressed along with our
own, and now is not.

Five canaries, each proven red: the exemption stopping the scan (the load-order
fail-open), the target exclusion removed, an unlocatable module treated as ours,
the module seam's failure ignored, and — re-run precisely — the payload seam's
failure ignored.

### S23 · What the 2026-08-05 handoff audit found and did NOT fix

Eight PRs merged in one session; the audit ran afterwards, as
[adversarial review] prescribes, and found 53 items. The staleness was fixed in
the same PR that records this. What follows is the residue — real gaps, recorded
so the next session finds them by reading rather than by tripping over them.

**1. ✅ `FL_BUILD_ID` has a writer and no reader — closed 2026-08-05.**
`FlGuardBuildId` on `FrameLedger.Guard.dll` gives the Agent the value `04_CAPTURE`
calls "its own", and `FrameLedger.Shared.ShmHandshakeValidator` is the comparison.

**Why the GUARD carries it and not the Overlay.** The Overlay exports
`FlGetBuildId()`, and the Agent cannot call it: reaching that export means
`LoadLibraryW` on `FrameLedger.Overlay.dll`, which starts its init thread and
creates a ring under the **Agent's own pid**. The payload is not something its own
host may load. The guard is already loaded by the Agent, by absolute path from our
install directory (§S22).

**Guard and Overlay agree by construction, not by test, and that is stated rather
than implied.** `FL_BUILD_ID` is one INTERFACE compile definition on
`FrameLedger.Shm`, set once per CMake configure, and both targets link it. No test
asserts the equality because `fl_guard_abi.cpp` is not compiled into
`fl_guard_test` — `guard_test.cpp` says so at the assertion that covers the
Overlay's half.

**The failure this closes is a fail-open, and the test for it was nearly missed.**
The naive implementation compares two strings. With neither side carrying an id,
`string.Equals("", "")` is **true**, so the gate reports `Ok` and permits attaching
to anything — measured, by removing the emptiness guards and watching
`ShmAttachRefusal.Ok` come back. The first draft of the test file asserted "no id
of our own refuses" and "no id in the handshake refuses" as separate cases and
**never put both halves in one call**, which is the only arrangement that reaches
the defect. Recorded because a suite can cover each half of a condition and still
miss the condition.

<details><summary>The finding as recorded</summary>

**1. `FL_BUILD_ID` has a writer and no reader.** §S22-era work gave
`FlShmHandshake::buildId` a producer, which it had never had. But the contract is
a *comparison* — `07_IPC` "the Agent compares … against its own",
`04_CAPTURE` "validate layout version + build id against our own" — and the
managed side has no build id and no way to obtain one: `FL_BUILD_ID` is a CMake
INTERFACE compile definition visible only to native targets, and `grep -rni
buildid` over `src/**/*.cs`, `*.csproj` and `*.props` returns **zero**. So the
refuse-to-attach-on-mismatch gate still cannot run. Half a mechanism reads as a
whole one in the CHANGELOG, and that is corrected here rather than there.

</details>

**2. `rules-publish`'s removal check is not a required status check.** `main`'s
required contexts are exactly `check`, `analyze (csharp, none)` and
`analyze (cpp, manual)`. The `validate` job is path-filtered and runs on
`pull_request` only, so a red removal check **does not block the merge button** —
the gate that exists to make the anti-cheat blocklist un-removable is advisory.
Fixing it is a branch-protection change, i.e. the owner's, not a code change.

**3. 🅓 Deferred to P3, rationale written 2026-09-06 — `08_UI` describes a refusal notice that is wrong in the commonest case.** *(The requirement below must reach `08_UI` and the `Safety_*` keys in the PR that creates the first refusal UI, and not before: there is no UI to be wrong in yet, and a `.resx` string with no view is the kind of fix that reads as done. The spike log carries the measurement; this line is the reminder.)* It
promises "the specific signal named in plain language". Measured (`spike-notes`
§13): while any Easy Anti-Cheat title is running, **every** target — including a
freshly spawned, unrelated process — refuses with `BlockedService` naming
`EasyAntiCheat_EOS`, because checks 2 and 2b are machine-wide. The user is shown
the name of a game they are not playing. The requirement created by that
measurement was written only into the spike log; it needs to reach `08_UI` and
the `Safety_*` resx keys before any UI exists.

**4. ✅ The runtime re-scan loop is described as two checks and implements four — closed 2026-08-05.**
`19_SAFETY` §During a session now reads "every pre-injection check", deferring to the
one list in §Pre-injection checks — including its ⚠ that check 3's store-id half cannot
be called, which the re-scan inherits rather than closes. A list restated in two places
is what went stale; the fix is to stop restating it, not to correct the copy. The two
checks the old wording omitted are named there, with why each matters.

> **This closure was itself stale within hours, and the mechanism is worth naming.**
> The sentence it landed said *"including its ⚠ that check 3 is unwired … one of the
> four documented ones still does not [run]"*. #52 rewrote that ⚠ three hundred lines
> away and the pointer kept paraphrasing the old text — **the exact restate-in-two-
> places failure this item was closed for, committed by the closure.** Deferring to
> another section does not help if the pointer restates what it points at; a paraphrase
> is a copy. It was also wrong about the count: 2b is a documented check, so five run,
> not four. Corrected 2026-08-05.

<details><summary>The finding as recorded</summary>
`19_SAFETY` §During a session reasons explicitly about the loop's composition and
names the module and driver scans. `GuardSupervisor.ScanOnceAsync` →
`FlGuardEvaluate` → `EvaluateImpl` runs drivers, **services** and the **static
pre-scan** as well. That omits the only tier ever measured firing on real
anti-cheat (services) and the only one touching the filesystem (check 4) — whose
cost this session raised by deepening the walk. The paragraph that decides what
the loop costs is missing the expensive half.

</details>

**5. ✅ A fourth statement of the gate's composition lived in the shipped data — closed 2026-08-05.**
`rules/detection-rules.json`'s own `$comment` enumerated the checks that run,
omitting 2b and omitting `services` from the signals that catch the seed — in the
one copy that ships to users. Three doc-side variants were reconciled that
session; this one was not, and `rules-validate`'s doc/data cross-check reads the
blocklist table, not the comment.

> **Closed the way §S23-4 closed the same class: by removing the restatement, not
> by correcting it.** The comment now states only facts about *this data* — that

**6. `legal/` is audited by nothing.** Every other document is bound to the code
by something — `rules-validate` cross-checks the blocklist against `19_SAFETY`,
`static_assert`s bind `fl_shm.h` to `07_IPC`, `versioninfo-check` and
`chokepoint-check` bind claims to binaries. `legal/` has one hand-written
accuracy block, in one of four files, with a hardcoded count. It went stale
within hours: a fourth unimplemented promise was added directly beneath a header
saying "Three". The block now says so about itself, which is a note and not a
gate.

### S14 ◐ · Pre-injection check 3 is **unwired**, and has no "cannot determine" state

nothing.

The gate is not currently weakened — checks 1, 2, 2b, 3 (exe) and 4 run, and
every family in the seed is caught by a module, driver, service or directory
signal — but a documented check that does nothing will read as "this title is
not a known online title" to the next person who trusts it. That still applies
to the store-id half, and to the executable half for as long as its list ships
empty.

Two decisions, both the owner's:

1. **Which titles.** Seeding a list of competitive/online games is a product
   decision with false-refusal consequences, not a mechanical fill-in.
2. **What "unknown" means.** A title the user added by exe path has no store id,
   and store metadata is opt-in (CLAUDE.md rule 8). "No store id" must not read
   as "not blocked", and a renamed exe defeats `blockedExecutables` the same
   way. Whatever ships, an unresolvable identity has to land on *unknown*, and
   the doc must say where unknown goes — which today it does not.

Until both are answered the inertness is recorded in the data's own `$comment`
and beside check 3, rather than being inferable only from two empty arrays.

The Overlay is specified to install a `LoadLibrary` hook for lazily
loaded graphics DLLs (`17_HOOK_ENGINE` §DLL entry); the same hook could raise the
control-block flag the moment a blocklisted module name loads, turning a 30 s
poll into near-immediate detection. This is the cheapest available improvement to
the behavior the product treats as most critical.

**Needs:** confirmation that a name comparison against a small fixed table is
acceptable in that hook under the no-allocation rule (it should be), and a
decision on whether it supplements or replaces the poll. Supplements — the poll
also catches modules loaded before we hooked.

### S7 ✅ · Guard handle rights and WOW64 — **closed**

Measured unelevated 2026-08-02 by `src/native/tools/fl-probe-guard` (ctest
`fl_guard_apis`); evidence in `spike-notes.md` §1, rule now written into
`19_SAFETY` §Pre-injection checks item 1.

The read handle rights are sufficient. `LIST_MODULES_ALL` is mandatory: on a
live 32-bit target the default filter returned **7 of 15** modules *as a
success*, which is the under-report that would read as clean. And every failure
of the call — `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED (5)` on a protected target,
`ERROR_PARTIAL_COPY (299)` on a suspended one — means REFUSE, never "no modules
found".

The one branch that could **not** be measured here is a service query returning
`ACCESS_DENIED`: a standard user holds `SERVICE_QUERY_STATUS` on the stock
service set, so it has to be driven from a unit-test fake. Recorded in
`spike-notes.md` §1 rather than left to look covered.

### S8 ✅ · The absence-of-override mechanism — **closed**

The intent was right and is kept; the mechanism was wrong and is replaced.
Rewritten in `14_TESTING` §Safety-guard tests.

The original — a `sealed` token type "only the guard can produce", passed as a
constructor argument — was disproved by compiling: C# accessibility flows
*inward*, so an enclosing type cannot reach a nested private constructor
(`CS0122`). (`internal` *does* hold across an assembly boundary — `CS1729` when
`Infrastructure` tries to forge one — but that was never the weak part.)

The real weakness is that **any token which escapes can simply be ignored**: a
caller can decline to ask for one. §S13(a) put the guard in C++, which makes the
stronger shape natural — the guard **owns the chokepoint** and calls the
injection primitive itself, the primitive has internal linkage in the guard's own
translation unit so no other TU has a symbol to call, and a build-time check
asserts nothing else references it. A token that escapes can be ignored; a symbol
that does not exist cannot be called.

### S9 ✅ · `FrameLedger.Injector.exe` — **closed: it does not exist**

Decided 2026-08-02, written into `12_BUILD` §Targets. `FrameLedger.Injector` is
a **static lib only**. A user-runnable `LoadLibraryW` injector is a path into a
game process that the guard does not stand in front of, and no invocation
contract makes that safe — a guard result crossing a process boundary is exactly
the forgeable clearance §S13(b) rejects. The Agent links the lib; the guard owns
the chokepoint inside it, so there is no entry point that skips the gate. Manual
testing uses `hook-harness`.

### S10 ✅ · Machine-wide layer registration without consent — **closed**

Written into `12_BUILD` §The Vulkan layer is not registered at install time.
The install-time registration is removed; the rule is now the one
`17_HOOK_ENGINE` §Vulkan always stated — **registered only while at least one
Vulkan game has hooking enabled**, unregistered when the last is disabled and on
uninstall, under `HKCU`. The `--register-vklayer` flag and the Settings button
are repair tools that reflect that state, not independent grants of machine-wide
reach.

Note this is a *consent and blast-radius* fix, not the §S2 guard fix. A
registered layer still loads into every Vulkan process while it is registered;
narrowing *when* it is registered reduces the window, and `enable_environment`
plus the in-layer scan (§S2) is what closes the hole.

### S11 ✅ · FR-2.2 / FR-2.3 interaction — **closed**

Specified in `19_SAFETY` §A game already enabled can become blocked later. The
pre-scan re-runs on every rules update and every exe change; a new match forces
`hook_enabled = 0` and sets `hook_blocked_reason` — **no schema change needed,
the column already exists** (`06_DATA_MODEL` §games) and a non-null value already
means "toggle disabled". `hook_consent_at` is preserved: the block is not a
withdrawal of consent. A rules update that removes a match does **not** re-enable
hooking on its own, because that would let the rules feed switch injection on for
a game with nobody looking.

### S12 ✅ · "Cautious mode" — **closed by deferring it, explicitly**

Deferred to v1.1 with the overlay, recorded in `19_SAFETY` §Crash & stability
safety. It was defined as "hooks installed, overlay drawing disabled" and **v1
draws no overlay** (FR-15 is v1.1), so it disabled nothing — a no-op dressed as a
safety measure, which is worse than an absent feature because it reads as
coverage. The breadcrumb is still written and still read in v1; the behaviour
that actually protects the user is the existing two-crashes-in-60s auto-disable.

## H — Native hook layer. Blocks P1.

> **H1 and H3 are resolved, and both flags are now applied** to the Overlay and
> the Vulkan layer via the `fl_hostile_env_flags` interface target. Evidence in
> `spike-notes.md` §3; the probe lives at `src/native/tools/fl-probe-hookprofile`

### H2 ◐ · `LoadLibrary` hook, the loader lock, and MinHook's thread suspension

**Partly answered — the safe path is verified, the hazard is still an argument.**

`fl-probe-hookprofile` ran 20 MinHook enable/disable cycles, each suspending
every other thread to patch, while a worker performed 4,510
`LoadLibrary`/`FreeLibrary` cycles. No deadlock. So the **deferred** pattern
`17_HOOK_ENGINE` §DLL entry mandates is sound under heavy loader contention.

What is *not* proven is that the naive inline install deadlocks. A probe that
deadlocks cannot report its own result, and hanging CI to demonstrate a hazard
we have already chosen to avoid buys nothing — so the case against inlining
still rests on the mechanism (suspending a thread that holds the loader lock),
not on a measurement.

**Remaining:** exercise the deferred path against a real game that loads D3D12
lazily, which is the case the hook exists for. Until then, keep the rule and do
not let anyone "simplify" it back to an inline install on the grounds that the
probe never showed a deadlock.

> **The deferred path is built and exercised in a fixture (2026-09-06, P1 item 1 — §S6).** The detour
> signals an auto-reset event the watchdog waits on with its 1 s timeout; it never calls MinHook.
> ctest `fl_guard` `[loader]` loads `sl.interposer.dll` into a presenting harness 2.3 s after start and
> sees the hook family within 94 ms, wake count ≥ 1, no fault, no stop. **Still owed, unchanged:** the
> real-game leg — a title that pulls Streamline or D3D12 in lazily, hooked through the wake — which the
> `loader detour:` report line will show as a non-zero wake count with the family present from the first
> bucket.

### H5 ✅ · Proxy swapchains defeat the dummy-vtable assumption — **the DLSS / DLSS-G question closed 2026-09-06 (owner)**

> **CLOSED 2026-09-06, 12:17, on Cronos: The New Dawn demo with frame generation ON (`spike-notes` §9).**

> (driver-reported)`, RT Yes. **So the pacer that bypasses the patched `Present` bodies is Dying Light:

> ### THE STREAMLINE DOCS, READ 2026-09-05 (v2.8.0 and main), AND WHAT THEY CHANGED
>
> The owner asked for the vendor's own guides before any rewrite. Three things in them decide this item.
>
> 1. **DLSS-G presents through the "SL pacer"** (DLSS-G guide §14.1): an asynchronous presentation
>    mechanism, with *"specialized hardware to delay the image after Present() has been called"* and a
>    note that `MsBetweenPresents` in third-party tools *"indicates when the internal Present() call has
>    happened"*. So the generated frames ARE presented by internal `Present()` calls on 2.7.1 — which is
>    what this hook counts on Cyberpunk — and whether 2.8's pacer on Blackwell still reaches the body we
>    patch is exactly what Leg 1's PresentMon half measures. The docs do not say; they say FrameView 16.1
>    is the recommended tool because it reads `MsBetweenDisplayChange`, i.e. the display side.
> 2. **`slDLSSGGetState` is the documented way to get the presented count** (§14.0: `actualFPS = myFPS *
>    state.numFramesActuallyPresented`) — and it is **refused here**, with the reason in `03_METRICS` §FG:
>    the header defines the field as *"number of frames presented since the last `slDLSSGGetState` call"*,
>    so every call RESETS the plugin's counter, and a title that reads it for its own FPS display would
>    read our calls' remainder. It is also marked *"NOT thread safe"*. A measurement that alters the
>    host's measurement is not observing.
> 3. **§5.0 "Tag all required resources": DLSS-G requires the HUD-less and UI buffers to be tagged every
>    frame** through `slSetTag` / `slSetTagForFrame` / `slEvaluateFeature`'s inputs — the three routes this
>    build already hooks and read ONE tag type from. **Built the same day:** every tag's type is recorded
>    (`FlWriterState.slTagCensus`, per route), a HUD-less or UI tag drained by a present marks it
>    `FL_FG_DLSS_G`, and the consumer names `DlssG` beside an active count. Identity, not a count: the
>    count still decides `none`, so a title tagging the inputs with the feature off prints `none` with the
>    inputs noted, and the withheld shape keeps its N/A.
>
> **Pre-committed for the next run, per title:** Cyberpunk at DLSS + MFG → `frame generation: DlssG`,
> tag census `global=[depth, mvec, hudless, ui-color-alpha, …]` (2.7.1 tags globally; the scaling input
> arrives locally). Hell Is Us / Expedition 33 / Wukong at DLSS + FG ×4 → `DlssG` **if** the UE Streamline
> plugin tags through the exports (their `UpscalerParams = 0` says no scaling-input tag arrived, which is
> consistent with NGX-direct super-resolution and says nothing about the DLSS-G inputs); if the census
> reads `global=[-] frame=[-] local=[-]` on those titles, they tag through neither export and the identity
> stays `Active (technology not identified)` honestly. DL:TB at DLSS FG ×4 → the census line says whether
> the title feeds DLSS-G through a route this build sees; the qualifier then says *"FEEDING frame
> generation"* beside the withheld count. Lies of P at DLSS (no Streamline tokens at all) → unchanged:
> the super-resolution identity on NGX-direct titles is what the NVAPI probe above is for.

**Partly answered, and the news is better than expected.** `hook-harness
--probe-proxy` builds a real forwarding `IDXGISwapChain` wrapper — what
`sl.interposer` and ReShade hand the application — and presents through it with
our hook on the **real** vtable. The hook still fires: the proxy forwards via
`real_->Present(...)`, an ordinary virtual dispatch, so patching the real vtable
catches it one layer down. A proxy having its own vtable does *not* by itself
make us miss the present.

**What still has to be measured on a real title:**

1. A forwarding proxy is the easy case. DLSS-G presents *interpolated* frames
   the application never submitted — whether those reach a real-vtable hook is
   what actually matters for the FG counting in `03_METRICS` §Frame Generation,
   and the harness cannot simulate it.
2. We observe the post-proxy call, so parameters the proxy rewrote are what we
   see, not what the game passed.
3. A proxy that owns a *different* swapchain, rather than wrapping ours, would
   still be invisible.

Needs a real Streamline/DLSS-G title, ideally with RTSS and the Steam overlay
also active (`spike-notes.md` §Environment — that machine already has both).

### H6 · D3D12 command-list hooks count recorded, not executed, work

`DispatchRays`, `BuildRaytracingAccelerationStructure` and pipeline creation are
recorded into command lists, possibly on many threads, possibly re-executed or
never executed. `17_HOOK_ENGINE` §Ring writer keeps per-frame counters in "a
small struct updated by the feature hooks and *read* by the present hook" with no
synchronisation specified — a data race as written, and semantically it counts
recording rather than execution.

**Needs:** a specified concurrency model (per-thread counters aggregated at
present is the obvious one) and an explicit statement that RT activity means
"recorded this frame", with the accuracy budget in `03_METRICS` adjusted to say
so.

### H7 ✅ · Vtable restore on unhook clobbers later hookers — **closed**

Fixed and specified in `17_HOOK_ENGINE` §Compare-and-restore, never
unconditional restore. Verified by `hook-harness --probe-unhook`, ctest
`fl_unhook_preserves_foreign`.

The "cleaner uninstall" claim was backwards: a later hooker saves **our detour**
as its original and chains through it, so writing the pristine address back
removes their hook silently. Both halves of the contract are asserted — we
decline to restore when the slot changed, **and** we do restore when it did not,
because a compare-and-restore that never restores is not a fix.

Simulated rather than depending on RTSS being installed, so it is deterministic
and runs on CI. Confirming against the six overlays actually resident on the dev
machine (`spike-notes.md` §Environment) is still worth doing once the Overlay has
real hooks, but the mechanism no longer rests on that.

### H8 ✅ · "Never crash the game" — **closed**

NFR-3 reworded in `02_SPEC` to what the mechanism can actually support: faults
*originating in our own hook bodies* are contained, counted and self-disable
after three. The absolute promise is gone, and stays out of user-facing text —
the Disclaimer's existing "injection carries risk" wording is the honest one.

Recorded alongside it, because it is the sharpest instance: `-D_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=0`
turns a would-be STL throw into `__fastfail`, which SEH cannot intercept
(`spike-notes.md` §H3). The "no throwing STL in hook paths" rule is therefore
load-bearing rather than stylistic.

HANDOFF item 3 asks for this to be *deferred with a written rationale rather than
guessed*, and this is that rationale. The deferral is the decision; it is not a
placeholder.

**What is measured** (`docs/vendor-exports.json`, dev machine, 2026-08-05):

| Module | Exports that would identify frame generation |
|---|---|
| `libxess_fg.dll` | `xefgSwapChainD3D12InitFromSwapChain`, `…GetSwapChainPtr`, `…SetEnabled` — 28 of its 31 exports are `xefgSwapChain*` |
| `ffx_fsr3_x64.dll` | `ffxFsr3SkipPresent` |
| **`amd_fidelityfx_framegeneration_dx12.dll` (3.1.5, in three installed titles)** | **five generic `ffx*` entry points and nothing else** |

**Why the third row is the blocker.** On the newer AMD module the symbol name carries
no identity at all: which *feature* a call configures is decided by a **field inside a
struct passed as an argument**, and we have no headers for that struct. Reading it
would mean hand-declaring a vendor ABI from observation — which is exactly what
`#71` proved fatal in the Streamline case, where a module kept the symbol NAME and
changed the SIGNATURE and a wrong argument list yields *a wrong answer rather than a
crash*, the failure class `17_HOOK_ENGINE` calls the highest false-confidence risk in
the spike. A guessed struct layout is the same defect with a different vendor's name
on it.

**Whether the headers may be vendored is not the obstacle** — `18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS`
§Checklist has to rule on FidelityFX and XeSS-FG licences before either could be
consumed, and nobody has run that checklist for them. So there are two gates here,
and the licence one has not even been opened.

**What the deferral costs, stated so it is not rediscovered as a surprise.** An XeFG
or FSR3-FG title reports `fgMode = FL_FG_UNKNOWN` and `FL_MEASURED_FG` set — *"a hook
ran and could not identify what it saw"*, which is the honest state and is already
what `dllmain.cpp` publishes. It does **not** report `NONE`, so nothing is aggregated
as a negative. The cost is coverage, not correctness.

**What would lift it**, in order: run `18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS` §Checklist on the FidelityFX
and XeSS-FG SDK licences; if either clears, vendor the header **with its consumer in
the same commit** (the rule §2b's `sl_dlss.h` landed under); and only then decode the
struct — never before, and never from observation.

**Related and NOT the same question.** Both vendors also take over the present
(§H5 case 3, and item 3's own entry), which is a separate hazard: identity is what
this item defers, and whether generated presents reach our vtable is what §H5 tracks.

### H10 · Per-process VRAM thread inside the game process

`17_HOOK_ENGINE` §Memory calls `QueryVideoMemoryInfo` "once per second from our
own thread". Spawning a thread inside a host process we do not own is a heavier
footprint than the rest of the design's posture, and DXGI calls off the render
thread need checking. Consider sampling on the present hook every N frames
instead, which needs no thread at all.

| # | Question |
|---|---|
| M1 ✅ | ~~Can PresentMon 2.x `FrameType` see **driver-level** frame generation (AMD AFMF)?~~ | **Closed by DECISION 2026-08-27, not by measurement, and the distinction matters.** PresentMon is dropped, so this question has no subject. What was learned before it went: `FrameType` reports events a vendor chose to emit, and NVIDIA's DLSS-G emits none (§S31 row P2) — so the "capability inversion" this row hoped for was never demonstrated for any vendor. If a Tier-2 mechanism is ever chosen (§G), ask this of **that** tool rather than reviving this row |
| M2 ✅ | ~~Does the pinned console binary still exist, run unelevated, and emit the 2.x column set?~~ | **Answered, then closed 2026-08-27.** It exists (2.5.1, 956,768 bytes, SHA256 `9BEC…A191`, **no VERSIONINFO at all**); it does **not** run unelevated (exit 6 — the account is in neither Administrators nor Performance Log Users, and the running `PresentMonSharedService` does not help because the console starts its own session); and the 2.x column set **is measured** — 24 columns, `spike-notes` §11. The parser ate three real CSVs and resolved `FrameType` correctly against a first column literally named `Application`. Closed because the binary is dropped, and kept in full because every one of those facts cost a measurement |
| M5 ✅ | **Do LHM GPU sensors work unelevated, without PawnIO?** **YES — measured 2026-09-03, row R1 of the pre-committed table below**, NVIDIA RTX 5080 / 616.56 / LHM 0.9.6: eight fields unelevated (core and memory temperature, load, VRAM used, core and memory clock, package power, fan), the identical eight in the elevated control, PawnIO never opened. The three user-facing sentences stand. Numbers in `spike-notes` §10. *(The row as it stood while open follows, unchanged.)* This decides whether the default unelevated Agent has temperatures at all, and therefore how ADR-9 reads to users. **SEVERITY PROMOTED 2026-08-28, and the promotion is the point.** It used to decide how a design note read. It now decides whether a **user-facing claim is true**: the two-rung ladder says a Tier-2 session records duration and hardware telemetry, and that sentence is heading for `README`, the consent dialog and `legal/EULA.md`. If LHM needs elevation for GPU sensors, then the DEFAULT Agent's Tier-2 session is **duration only** and every one of those documents is wrong. Until it is measured, all three are worded *"whatever hardware telemetry this machine can provide"* — honest under either outcome, at the cost of vagueness. `18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS` §P0(b) already specifies the test and the dev box can run it |
| M6 ✅ | ~~Elevation-free Tier 2~~ | **Closed by decision 2026-08-27.** Half was answered on 2026-08-20 in the direction nobody expected: `PresentMonSharedService` is installed and `Running` as LocalSystem and the console **still** fails, because it starts its own trace session. The other half — whether `Performance Log Users` suffices without admin — stays unmeasured and now has no subject. **The elevation question does not disappear with the tool**: ETW trace sessions are restricted by Windows, not by PresentMon, so whatever §G chooses inherits it. Re-ask it there |
| M7 ✅ | ~~`18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS` §Runtime policy says telemetry is never read from the game process, but `17_HOOK_ENGINE` reads per-process VRAM and Reflex latency there. Reconcile the wording — the rule means "no vendor SDK polling loops in the game", not "no measurement in the game"~~ **Closed 2026-09-09 (PR-E1) by the code taking exactly that shape.** The rule is *no telemetry polling loop in the game*: the one 1 Hz loop is `TelemetryPoller` on the Agent's `fl-telemetry` thread, and it reads L1/L2/L3 only. Per-process VRAM stays an in-process read on the present path (`vram_proc`, `17_HOOK_ENGINE`), and PR-E1 measured why that must be so: `IDXGIAdapter3::QueryVideoMemoryInfo`'s `CurrentUsage` is the *calling process's* figure — 0 bytes from the Agent — so it is a measurement only where the game is. Adapter-wide usage is L1's PDH counter. §Runtime policy's sentence stands as written; this row is the reconciliation |
| M8 ✅ | ~~The `GpuSample` type has no latency field, yet L3 is credited with Reflex/PC latency. Latency is per-frame and arrives via the ring, not the 1 Hz sample. Fix the layering description~~ **Closed 2026-09-09 (PR-E1): the description now matches the type.** `GpuSample` has no latency field by design (its own remarks said so since 2026-09-03), `TelemetrySample` carries a 1 Hz reading stamped with QPC, and per-frame latency is `FlFrameRecord.reflexLatencyUs` in the ring. The §L3 table row "Reflex / PC latency" is an *in-process hook fact* the Overlay records (`SetSleepMode` / `SetLatencyMarker`, `17_HOOK_ENGINE`), never a poller field; `NvapiTelemetrySource` (PR-E2) will not call `NvAPI_D3D_GetLatency` |
| M9 ✅ | **Closed 2026-08-02 by a decision.** The old file/module detection does not exist in this repository and the owner confirmed there is no copy elsewhere, so **"build a minimal static-hint detector as the measurement baseline" is now P0 item 3** (`15_ROADMAP`). It needs no guard and no injection. Until it exists, ADR-7's headline claim stays out of the README rather than being asserted unmeasured |
| M10 ✅ | ~~PDH `\GPU Engine(*)\Utilization Percentage` summed across engines does not reproduce the Task Manager figure the doc invokes. Decide what we actually report and label it accordingly~~ **Decided 2026-09-09 (PR-E1): L1 does not read the engine counters at all.** `LoadPct` is L2's vendor-reported `GPU Core` load (measured ✓ on NVIDIA, §M5 row R1) and is labelled *GPU load (vendor)* wherever it is shown; on a machine without L2 the field is N/A, never a sum that is not the number the user expects. What L1 does read from PDH is one counter, `\GPU Adapter Memory(luid_…_phys_0)\Dedicated Usage`, bound by LUID — the figure Task Manager labels "Dedicated GPU memory", measured 1301 MB at an idle desktop on the RTX 5080. Reopening this needs a measurement of `max(engine)` against Task Manager's own number, not a decision |

#### §M5 — the decision table, pre-committed 2026-09-03 BEFORE the first run

The §S30 / §S31 discipline: write down what each outcome means before the instrument
produces one, so the result cannot be read into the conclusion that is most convenient.
The instrument is `FrameLedger.CaptureHost probe-lhm`, run **unelevated first**, then once
elevated as a control — the control exists to separate *"needs elevation"* from *"this
driver / this LHM version has no such sensor on an RTX 5080"*, which read identically from
the unelevated run alone. The five fields the row is decided on are the ones `README`'s
Tier-2 sentence would name if it named any: **core temperature, load, power, adapter VRAM
used, core clock.**

| Row | Unelevated, no PawnIO, `Computer { IsGpuEnabled }` only | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| **R1** | All five fields non-null | The three documents stand and may name the fields instead of saying *"whatever"*. `18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS` L2 row → ✓. §M5 ✅ |
| **R2** | A non-empty subset non-null | The three documents name exactly that subset. If the consent sentence changes, `OperatorDisclosure.Version` /2 → /3. §M5 ✅ with the subset recorded |
| **R3** | LHM enumerates a GPU and every sensor reads null | The default unelevated Agent's Tier-2 session is **duration + reason only**. `README:67`, `legal/EULA.md:15` and `OperatorDisclosure.cs` narrow accordingly, /3. §M5 🔴 until those edits land in the same PR |
| **R4** | `Open()` / `Accept()` throws, or a poll never returns | As R3, and the *"throws or hangs twice ⇒ disabled for the session"* rule (`18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS` §Runtime policy) is exercised by a real fault rather than a fixture. Record separately whether the failure names PawnIO, because that would mean the GPU path is not user-mode after all |

Two things this table does NOT decide, stated so the run is not read as deciding them:
which of the fields AMD or Intel expose (§R5/§R6, untestable here), and whether the CPU
and board sensors need PawnIO (they do, by LHM's own design — `--cpu` is deliberately not
an option of the probe, so the run cannot accidentally measure that instead).

**RESULT, 2026-09-03 — R1, both runs.** Unelevated: all five deciding fields plus memory
temperature, memory clock and fan; through the port, `Capabilities` reads the same eight
and `faults=0`. Elevated control, launched through UAC: the same eight fields, the same
verdict, values within idle drift. Hotspot temperature is the one field this vendor did
**not** expose — there is no `GPU Hot Spot` sensor in the tree at all, which is a property
of this driver / GPU / library combination and not of elevation. One defect the raw tree
caught before the verdict: the first draft of `SensorMap` mapped `D3D Shared Memory Used`
(system RAM) to adapter VRAM by a fragment rule; fixed and pinned by a test in the same
PR, which is what printing the raw tree ahead of the interpretation is for.
Consequences taken: the three sentences stand (`README`'s row may now name the fields and
does), `OperatorDisclosure.Version` stays /2, `18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS` L2 NVIDIA column filled,
AMD / Intel untouched.

## G — Missing specifications. Block P2–P4.

Each of these is referenced by an existing doc but specified nowhere.

| Area | What is missing | Referenced by |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent lifecycle** | Scheduled-task definition, start-at-logon, how elevation is requested and persisted, what "Repair" repairs | `08_UI` Settings, `11_UPDATER`, `12_BUILD` flags |
| **Session identity** | ~~`sessions` has no GUID column, yet `SessionStarted`/`StopSession`/`.partial` files are all keyed by `sessionGuid`.~~ **`sessions.session_guid` (UNIQUE) exists since 2026-09-09 (P2 PR-B), with `qpc_epoch` / `qpc_frequency` beside it.** ~~Still open: the `.partial` file format is undefined, and it is the crash-recovery artifact — PR-D's, pre-committed in HANDOFF §P2 (CRC-framed append-only chunks, the valid prefix wins)~~ **Built 2026-09-10 (P2 PR-D): `06_DATA_MODEL` §The `.partial` file, `PartialSessionFile` + `PartialRecovery`, killed at every byte in the merge gate.** What stays open here is the pipe's use of the guid (P3) | `07_IPC`, `04_CAPTURE`, `06_DATA_MODEL` |
| **Settings registry** | The `settings` table is key/value with no key list, defaults, types, or validation — and no message for the UI to push a changed setting to the Agent | `06_DATA_MODEL`, FR-10 |
| **Error taxonomy** | `07_IPC` lists `CaptureError` codes; no canonical mapping to resx keys and user-facing text, though `09_I18N` requires safety strings to be reviewed as legal text | `07_IPC`, `09_I18N` |
| **Threading model** | Which component owns which thread, UI-thread rules, and how the 1 Hz telemetry poller, 10 Hz drain and pipe reader interact | `04_CAPTURE`, `18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS` |
| **Pipe/shm security** | Stated as policy ("DACL granting the current user's SID") but not as implementable SDDL, nor who creates the objects with what rights | `07_IPC` |
| **Legal doc versioning** | FR-11 re-shows documents "when a document version increments". Nothing says where the current version lives, who writes `legal_acceptance.version`, or how the markdown is rendered in-app | FR-11, `06_DATA_MODEL` |
| **Accessibility / DPI** | NFR-9 states requirements; no design anywhere | NFR-9, `08_UI` |
| **Uninstall / data deletion** | One Velopack clause. No in-app "delete all my data", despite the privacy position | `12_BUILD`, `legal/PRIVACY_POLICY.md` |
| **Cover art** | Appears in the schema, the data directory and the UI; nothing says where it comes from or the licence position on downloaded store art | `06_DATA_MODEL`, `05_DETECTION` |
| **Tier-2 mechanism** *(was: PresentMon distribution)* | **By what mechanism does a shipped build reach a no-injection MEASUREMENT?** Nothing names one. Since 2026-08-28 the ladder is two rungs and Tier 2 is explicitly not a measurement — duration, sensors and the reason — so this row is no longer about degraded fidelity but about whether that capability returns at all. **It now owns TWO casualties, not one:** the frame-generation oracle §S31 spent four attempts looking for, and `14_TESTING`'s Tier-1 accuracy cross-check, struck the same day because it required a second instrument measuring the same frames. **One mechanism would restore both**, which is the strongest argument for costing it. Constraints on any answer: `README`'s capture-tier table and its **safety** row *"always a way out"*, `legal/DISCLAIMER.md` §73 and `legal/EULA.md` §33; ETW needs elevation whatever the tool; and `15_ROADMAP` has no v2 fallback either | `README`, `legal/DISCLAIMER.md`, `legal/EULA.md`, `04_CAPTURE`, `14_TESTING`, `15_ROADMAP` |

## R — Roadmap resequencing

~~1–4 are folded into `15_ROADMAP` (2026-08-02) and are no longer proposals:~~
the guard is **item 0**, the Vulkan passthrough test is **item 1**, the two
licence checks were run first and came back clear (`spike-notes.md` §0), and
P0's exit criteria no longer import P2 work — the FPS-impact measurement moves
to the end of P1, while the harness-level per-present cost (no game, no Agent,
no drain) stays in P0. Items 5–9 below are still open.
5. **P0 item 5 asks for an AFMF decision on an RTX 5080.** AFMF is AMD driver
   -side. Reword to "validate on NVIDIA; record AFMF as untested", per the
   precedent `14_TESTING` already sets for absent hardware.
6. **`18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS`'s capability matrix cannot be filled for AMD/Intel** on
   the stated dev machine, yet it drives what the UI advertises as available.
   Leave explicit "untested" markers rather than `?`.

   > #### 🅓 §R5 and §R6 deferred 2026-08-05, by owner decision, with this rationale
   >
   > **The AMD/Intel half of the capability matrix and the AFMF question are not
   > deferred for cost — they are unreachable on the only machine that exists.**
   > `spike-notes.md` §Environment records it: one adapter, an RTX 5080, and a `KF`
   > CPU with no iGPU. There is no measurement to take. Deferring is the only
   > honest option; the alternative is a matrix filled from documentation, which is
   > exactly what §M3/§M4 were run first to avoid.
   >
   > **The NVIDIA half is not deferred** and remains P0 item 8: L1 (DXGI + PDH),
   > L2 (LibreHardwareMonitor — including §M5, whether GPU sensors work unelevated
   > without PawnIO, which decides whether the default Agent has temperatures at
   > all) and L3 (NVAPI). None of it exists in code today.
   >
   > **What the deferral costs.** The matrix drives what the UI advertises as
   > available, so on AMD and Intel hardware v1 ships advertising capabilities
   > nobody has verified. The mitigation is the marker, not a guess: **`untested`,
   > never `?`, and never a checkmark inferred from a vendor's documentation.**
   >
   > **And the matrix as written cannot record this deferral**, which is its own
   > defect and is why the note lives here as well as there: its columns are
   > `L1 | L2 | L3` with no vendor axis, so "measured on NVIDIA, untested on
   > AMD/Intel" is not expressible in it. Whoever fills it for item 8 has to add
   > that axis first, or the distinction this deferral rests on is lost in the
   > artifact that consumes it.
7. **CI is scheduled for P5**, but CLAUDE.md makes green C# **and** C++ builds
   plus passing tests a per-PR gate from the first PR. CI belongs in bootstrap.
8. **P1 at 1.5 weeks is the largest under-estimate** — present hooks for three
   API families, feature hooks for four vendor SDKs, RT and PSO hooks, ring
   writer, fault policy, unhook path, native logging, injector launch *and*
   attach modes, plus the fully-tested guard that `19_SAFETY` calls the one
   component where a bug can cost someone an account.
9. **The `ja` safety-string reviewer is on the critical path but appears in P4.**
   `09_I18N` fails the build until a human signs off on safety translations.
   Identify the reviewer during bootstrap and draft the `Safety_*` keys as soon
   as the consent wording is stable.
10. **Four artifacts the documents name do not exist, and one of them is claimed
    as a gate that runs.** Found 2026-08-04 by an audit of the repository's own
    status records, and grouped here rather than fixed one by one because the
    decision is the same for all of them: build it, or stop describing it as
    present.

    | Named where | Artifact | State |
    |---|---|---|
    | `12_BUILD:139`, `13_CI_CD:11`, `09_I18N:28`, `CLAUDE.md:66` | `tools/resx-audit` | Absent. **Honestly handled** — `build.ps1:309` skips it loudly with a reason, and no `.resx` files exist yet |
    | `12_BUILD:136`, `13_CI_CD:11` | the managed **struct-mirror** test | ~~Absent. Nothing under `tests/` references `FlFrameRecord`.~~ **✅ Built in #47** — `ShmLayout.cs` + `ShmLayoutMirrorTests`, driven by `fl-layout-dump`'s JSON rather than a transcribed table, asserting blittability as well as offsets, and walking the field list in both directions. `build.ps1`'s gate now reads the run's `.trx` and fails when the class did not execute, so **deleting the test is red too** — it used to `Test-Path` a source file |
    | `13_CI_CD:21`, `12_BUILD:121`, `CHANGELOG:9` | `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Absent. `CHANGELOG`'s header instructs an author to write for a consumer that does not exist |
    | `12_BUILD` §Local quality gate | gates omitted from the list | ~~**Three documents give three different counts, which is the finding.** `build.ps1` has **15** `Write-Step` calls as of 2026-08-05 (14 before this PR's `changelog-check`); `12_BUILD` lists 10; this row said 13.~~ **Corrected 2026-08-06: `build.ps1` has 17 `Write-Step` calls** (`package-closure` added two), and `12_BUILD`'s list is rewritten to 16 numbered entries — the difference is that `Invoke-Native`'s three steps run under one heading there. `13_CI_CD` no longer restates the list at all; it points at `12_BUILD`, because restating it in two places is what let one of them rot. **Nothing still derives the list from the script**, so the drift is slowed rather than stopped, and this row remains open for that reason. **And it drifted again, exactly as predicted — re-counted 2026-08-28.** `hookinventory-check` had reached `build.ps1` and never reached the list; `frametype-oracle` had reached both and then been deleted with PresentMon, so the two errors happened to cancel and the *totals* matched while the *membership* did not — the same coincidence §S24's own recount was caught by. The list is rebuilt to **17 entries against 17 `Write-Step` calls, in script order** (re-deriving the order caught a second defect: two adjacent entries had been transposed relative to the script). **The row still does not close.** Aligning by hand is what was done in 2026-08-06 and again here; it lasts until the next gate lands. The fix is a gate that reads the `Write-Step` names out of `build.ps1` and fails when the list disagrees — until it exists, re-count rather than trusting the number |

    The struct-mirror row is the one that matters. `CLAUDE.md` §Struct mirroring
    makes that test the mechanism protecting the shared-memory ABI, and a doc that
    says a gate runs is worse than a doc that says it is missing — the second
    prompts someone to write it. **`build.ps1`'s skip-loudly discipline is the
    right answer here**: a gate that is not written should be named and skipped,
    not omitted.

    ~~Not urgent — the ring is P1 and there is nothing to mirror yet.~~ **That
    stopped being true on 2026-08-05.** `fl_shm.h` defines four structs with
    39 pinned offsets, `fl_ring.h` implements the protocol, and the Overlay
    writes real records into a real mapping — so there is now a live ABI with
    **nothing binding it to a managed reader**, which is the state the gate
    exists to prevent rather than the state that made it unnecessary. The count
    also grew: `build.ps1:324-329` enumerates **nine** files describing the
    mechanism in the present tense, and the two strongest sites are `fl_shm.h`
    (normative) and `fl-layout-dump/CMakeLists.txt` (a build file, which reads as
    a wiring fact rather than as prose). All nine were marked pending on
    2026-08-05; §S24 schedules the mirror itself.

    Recorded so it is found by reading, not by trusting.
