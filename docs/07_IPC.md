# 07 — IPC

Three channels, each chosen for its constraints:

| Channel | Between | Transport | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A. Frame ring** | Overlay DLL → Agent | Shared memory, lock-free SPSC | Hot path: no syscall allowed |
| **B. Control block** | Agent ↔ Overlay DLL | Same shared memory, atomics | Tiny, infrequent, must work even if the game is unresponsive |
| **C. Command pipe** | UI ↔ Agent | Named pipe, JSON | Rich, versioned, human-debuggable |

## A + B — shared memory (`Local\FrameLedger.Ring.<pid>`)

Created by the Overlay on init, opened by the Agent. Name is deliberately plain and identifiable (`19_SAFETY` — no obfuscated object names).

Layout — **four regions, each exactly one 64-byte cache line before the ring**:

```
[0x0000] FlShmHandshake  64 B  write-once by the Overlay at init
[0x0040] FlWriterState   64 B  Overlay-written (writeIndex touched every present)
[0x0080] FlControlBlock  64 B  Agent-written
[0x00C0] FlFrameRecord[capacity]   (64 B each, power-of-two capacity)
```

The header is split in two on purpose. The immutable handshake and the
per-present writer state have completely different access patterns, and keeping
the Agent's control line separate from both is what makes the no-false-sharing
claim true rather than aspirational: the Overlay writes line 2 every frame while
the Agent writes line 3 every second, and neither invalidates the other's line.

```cpp
struct alignas(64) FlShmHandshake {  // exactly 64 B, no padding holes
    uint32_t layoutVersion;      // @0  must equal FL_SHM_LAYOUT_VERSION on both sides
    uint32_t recordSize;         // @4  sizeof(FlFrameRecord); belt-and-braces against struct drift

    uint64_t adapterLuid;        // @56 which GPU the swapchain is on (multi-GPU selection)
};

    uint32_t reserved[5];        // @44..63 must be zero; reserved for additive fields
};

struct alignas(64) FlControlBlock {  // Agent-written
    uint32_t pauseRequested;     // @0
    uint32_t unhookRequested;    // @4  19_SAFETY: set when the guard fires mid-session
    uint32_t overlayEnabled;     // @8  in-game overlay draw toggle (v1.1)
    uint32_t guardTicks;         // @12 completed guard evaluations, NOT a timer
    uint32_t logFlushRequested;  // @16 a COUNTER: bumped by the Agent at session end; the watchdog flushes the native log on a change (17_HOOK_ENGINE §Native logging, 2026-09-06)
    uint32_t reserved[11];       // @20..63 must be zero
};

static_assert(sizeof(FlShmHandshake) == 64);
static_assert(sizeof(FlWriterState)  == 64);
static_assert(sizeof(FlControlBlock) == 64);
static_assert(FL_SHM_RING_OFFSET == 0xC0 && FL_SHM_RING_OFFSET % 64 == 0);
```

The cross-process fields are declared as plain integers and accessed through
`std::atomic_ref` rather than as `std::atomic<T>` members. `std::atomic<T>` has
no guaranteed layout, cannot be memcpy'd, and cannot be mirrored by a C#
`[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]` struct — and CLAUDE.md §Struct mirroring
requires exactly that mirror, with a test asserting every field offset on both
sides. `std::atomic_ref<uint32_t>` requires 4-byte alignment and
`std::atomic_ref<uint64_t>` 8-byte, which every offset above satisfies.

**Offset asserts apply to all three header structs, not just the record.** The
Agent reads `layoutVersion`, `recordSize`, `buildId`, `writeIndex` and
`faultCount` across the process boundary; a silent drift in any of them is the
same class of bug as record drift.

**Security:** the mapping is created with a DACL granting access only to the **current user's SID**; `Local\` namespace keeps it session-scoped. No `Global\` objects (would need admin and would be visible across sessions for no benefit).

**Protocol rules**

- **Writer (game) — seqlock per record.** `seq` lives at offset 56 *inside* the
  record, so "fill 64 bytes" would overwrite the very field guarding the write.
  The payload write must cover bytes `[0,56)` and `[60,64)` and **never touch
  `seq`**:

  ```cpp
  FlFrameRecord* slot = &ring[idx & (capacity - 1)];
  std::atomic_ref<uint32_t> seq{slot->seq};
  const uint32_t s = seq.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);  // sole writer of seq
  seq.store(s + 1, std::memory_order_relaxed);             // odd = writing
  std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_release);
  /* write payload — bytes [0,56) and [60,64), never slot->seq */
  std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_release);
  seq.store(s + 2, std::memory_order_relaxed);             // even = complete
  writeIndex.store(idx + 1, std::memory_order_release);    // via atomic_ref
  ```

  `seq` is **monotonic per slot and never reset**, so a full lap of the ring
  always changes it — otherwise a reader stalled for exactly one lap would
  validate a completely different frame as unchanged. Both fences compile to
  nothing on x86-64, so this costs zero against the ≤ 1 µs budget.

- **Reader (Agent).** `writeIndex.load(acquire)`; for each slot, load `seq`
  (acquire), skip if odd, copy, `atomic_thread_fence(acquire)`, then re-load
  `seq` and accept only if unchanged.

- **The ring carries FRAMES, and `DXGI_PRESENT_TEST` is not one.** The writer drops
  occlusion probes before allocating a slot, so `writeIndex` counts frames and no
  consumer has to remember to filter. Decided 2026-08-05; before that the question
  was assigned to nobody here and `03_METRICS` was silent about it.

  > A probe runs the presentation test and submits nothing — measured, 500 of them
  > leave `GetLastPresentCount` at 0 while 37 real presents move it by 37. An

- **A skipped torn record is a data gap, not a missing frame.** Dropping it
  silently makes the two surrounding frame times merge into one double-length
  interval — i.e. it *manufactures a stutter* in the metric the whole product
  exists to report. The drain must emit an explicit gap marker at that index;
  `03_METRICS` excludes gap-adjacent intervals from frame-time statistics and
  counts them toward the session's data-quality warnings.

- **Dropped records are computed by the Agent, not the writer.** The writer has
  no reader index and therefore cannot know whether the slot it is about to
  overwrite was ever consumed — the field was unimplementable as originally
  specified. The Agent computes it from the write index it already tracks:
  `if (writeIndex - readIndex > capacity) dropped += (writeIndex - readIndex) - capacity`,
  then resumes at `writeIndex - capacity`. This keeps the hot path free of an
  extra atomic and puts the accounting where the information actually exists.

- **The reader maps the whole section at offset 0, and the alternative is a silent
  memory-safety bug rather than a style choice.** Measured on .NET 10 / Windows 11
  26300: a view created at a non-zero offset is mapped from the 64 KiB
  allocation-granularity boundary *below* it, and `AcquirePointer` returns **that**
  base. So mapping region 3 at `0x80` and writing `*(uint*)(p + 12)` writes
  `FlShmHandshake.pid` — the field a reader validates first — instead of
  `FlControlBlock.guardTicks`. It does not fault, and `Read<T>` does not bounds-check
  it either, because the handle legitimately spans from byte 0. Mapping at zero makes
  the offsets in `fl_shm.h` usable as written, which is what the native
  `RingWriter::Init` and `RingReader::Init` already do. A reader must **assert**
  `PointerOffset == 0` rather than assume it.

- **`capacity` must be bounded against the mapping, not merely checked for
  power-of-two.** A reader that indexes by raw pointer arithmetic — which it must,
  because the seqlock needs ordering `MemoryMappedViewAccessor.Read<T>` does not
  provide — gives up that API's bounds check at the same time. So the handshake
  gained two refusals beyond the three above: `CapacityInvalid` (not a power of two)
  and **`CapacityExceedsMapping`**, taken from the mapped section's own byte length
  and never from a compiled-in default, which would be checking the handshake
  against an assumption instead of against the section it describes.
- Version handshake: Agent compares `layoutVersion` + `recordSize` + `buildId` against its own. **Mismatch → refuse to attach**, tell the user to restart the game (this happens when the app updates while a game is running).

- **`guardTicks` counts completed guard evaluations, not seconds.** It was
  specified as "Agent bumps every second", and a timer-driven tick is the wrong
  signal: it attests that the Agent *process* is alive, while the guard loop can
  be dead — a swallowed exception, or blocked in a service query, or stalled on
  one unreadable process in the §S16 scan set. A consumer reading "supervised"
  would then keep observing *because* the thing supervising it had stopped. The
  Agent increments it at exactly one site, after `Evaluate` returns a verdict.
  A refusal counts too, and also sets `unhookRequested`, so no consumer has to
  infer a verdict from a counter.
- **Supervision loss means stop observing.** If `guardTicks` has not advanced
  within **65 seconds** (`FL_GUARD_TICK_DEADLINE_MS`, `fl_shm.h`), the capture
  side stops recording.

  This used to read "the
  Overlay keeps writing (harmless)" — which described an *unsupervised hooked
  process* as harmless, and the 30 s re-scan `19_SAFETY` calls the most
  important runtime behaviour is exactly what has stopped in that state.
  One field cannot mean opposite things in two hosts, so the Overlay and the
  Vulkan layer share this rule.

  "Never advanced" and "stopped advancing" are the same state. The clock starts
  when the mapping is published, so a capture side that is never adopted by an
  Agent is inert from the beginning rather than enjoying a grace window.
- If `unhookRequested` is set, the Overlay disables hooks within one frame and sets `status = unhooked`. This path must be the fastest, most-tested code in the DLL: it is the safety stop.

## C — command pipe (`\\.\pipe\FrameLedger.v2`)

Unchanged in spirit from v1, bumped to `v2` for the new message set.

> **P3, not P2** (HANDOFF §P2 decision D10, restated 2026-09-10 with PR-F): the Agent's `--serve` is
> watcher-driven and logs to `logs\agent-*.log`; nothing below exists in code yet, and the P2 Agent has no
> client. The pipe reader joins the threading model as one more producer when it is written (`04_CAPTURE`).

- Message mode, single server (Agent), max 2 clients (UI + future CLI), `PIPE_REJECT_REMOTE_CLIENTS`.
- ACL: current interactive user's SID + Administrators. Reject clients whose token user differs.
- Framing: 4-byte LE length + UTF-8 JSON, max 1 MB. `System.Text.Json` source-generated contexts in `FrameLedger.Shared`.
- Envelope: `{ "type": …, "id": …, "payload": … }`; `Ack` correlates by `id`; events have no `id`.

### Messages

| Type | Dir | Payload / notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Hello` | UI→A | `{ appVersion, protocol: 2 }` → `HelloAck { agentVersion, protocol, elevated, overlayBuildId, vulkanLayerRegistered, telemetrySource /* composite, e.g. l1+lhm+nvapi */, cpuTempAvailable, etwAvailable }` |
| `GetStatus` | UI→A | → `StatusAck { state, activeSession?, tier? }` |
| `SetWatchlist` | UI→A | `{ entries: [{ gameId, exePath }] }` — full replace; UI re-sends on connect. **Carries no hooking state** (see §The pipe is not a trust boundary) |
| `LaunchGame` | UI→A | `{ gameId }` → suspended-launch + inject path (`04_CAPTURE` §Launch mode) |
| `SetHookEnabled` | UI→A | `{ gameId, enabled }` — Agent re-runs the static AC pre-scan and may reply `Refused`. **The Agent stamps the consent timestamp itself** |
| `PauseCapture` / `ResumeCapture` | UI→A | global |
| `StopSession` | UI→A | `{ sessionGuid }` — graceful unhook + finalize |
| `UpdateRules` | UI→A | **no payload** — a trigger, not a source. The Agent re-reads only its own `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FrameLedger\rules\` copy |
| `Shutdown` | UI→A | graceful stop |
| `SessionStarted` | A→UI | `{ sessionGuid, gameId, pid, tier, startedAt }` |
| `SessionProgress` | A→UI | 1 Hz: `{ elapsedS, nativeFps5s, displayedFps5s, fgFactor?, fgMode, upscaler, upscalerQuality, renderW/H, outputW/H, rtActive, gpuTempC?, cpuTempC?, vramProcMb, latencyUs? }` |
| `SessionCompleted` | A→UI | `{ sessionGuid, sessionId, exitStatus, tier }` — UI loads the full row from SQLite |
| `CaptureRefused` | A→UI | `{ gameId, reason, signal }` — **guard fired**; UI shows the plain-language explanation — ~~and the Tier-2 offer~~; there is no alternative measurement to offer, only the option to record the session unmeasured (`08_UI` §Safety events) |
| `CaptureDegraded` | A→UI | `{ sessionGuid, from, to, reason }` — Tier 1 → Tier 2 mid-flight, or overlay self-disabled. **Under a two-rung ladder this means measurement STOPPED**, not that it continued at lower fidelity, and the notice must say so |
| `SafetyUnhook` | A→UI | `{ sessionGuid, signal }` — anti-cheat appeared mid-session; prominent UI notice |
| `CaptureError` | A→UI | `{ code, message }` — `InjectFailed`, `RingVersionMismatch`, `EtwAccessDenied`, ~~`PresentMonMissing`~~ (retired with the tool, 2026-08-27 — a code naming an implementation nobody chose), `TelemetryUnavailable`, `DbWriteFailed` |
| `Ping`/`Pong` | both | 15 s keepalive |

## The pipe is not a trust boundary

The ACL restricts the pipe to the current user, and that is worth having — but
it is not a guarantee, because **everything the user runs is also the user**.
The gate must therefore survive a hostile client on this pipe, and three
messages were written as though it would not have to. All three are corrected
above; the reasoning is recorded here so they are not reintroduced as
conveniences.

**`UpdateRules { path }` was a documented override of the hard gate (§S3).** It
let any client hand the Agent an arbitrary filesystem path to load detection
*and anti-cheat* rules from — i.e. replace the blocklist with an empty one.
That is precisely the config-file flag `19_SAFETY` §The anti-cheat guard says
does not exist. It is now a bare trigger; the rules **source** is not a
parameter.

**`SetHookEnabled` took `consentAt` from the client.** The per-game informed
consent that FR-2.1 and `19_SAFETY` §User-facing consent make the basis of every
injection was therefore client-asserted, and a forged timestamp would have made
a game look consented-to that the user never saw a dialog for. The Agent stamps
`games.hook_consent_at` from its own clock when it accepts the enable, or
refuses. A client can *request*; it cannot *attest*.

**`SetWatchlist` carried `hookEnabled` and re-sent it on every connect.** The
adjacent `SetHookEnabled` re-runs the static anti-cheat pre-scan and may reply
`Refused`; `SetWatchlist` did not, while setting the same state in bulk. That
asymmetry is a bypass — and a self-healing one, because the UI re-sends the full
list on reconnect, so a value forced once would be re-asserted forever.
`SetWatchlist` now carries identity only. Enabling hooking has exactly one
message, and that message always re-scans.

> The general rule: **no inbound message may assert a safety fact.** It may ask
> for a state change, and the Agent then establishes the fact itself. Any new

## Client behavior (UI)

- Connect with 250 ms × 8 backoff; on failure start the Agent, retry; then show an Agent status banner with Repair.
- Treat the pipe as unreliable: library, history and charts must all work with the Agent offline. Only live status degrades.
- SQLite is the source of truth for anything persisted; pipe events are refresh signals (except `SessionProgress`, which is live-only by design).
- `CaptureRefused` and `SafetyUnhook` are **never** collapsed into a generic error toast — they get dedicated, explanatory UI (`08_UI` §Notifications).

## Versioning

`protocol` bumps only on breaking changes; additive fields are always allowed and unknown fields must be ignored (tested on both sides). `FL_SHM_LAYOUT_VERSION` bumps whenever `FlFrameRecord` or the header changes — and because the DLL lives inside a running game, the Agent must handle mismatch gracefully rather than assuming lockstep.
