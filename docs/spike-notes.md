# P0 spike notes

P0's named deliverable (`15_ROADMAP` §P0). Where measured results go, not
predictions. (It began empty by design and is now the longest record here.)

Rules:

- Record what was **observed**, with the machine, driver version, game and SDK
  version it was observed on. A result without its context is not reusable.
- Record failures and dead ends too. "We tried X, it deadlocked, here is why" is
  worth more than silence, and prevents the next person retrying it.
- When an entry answers an item in `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`, fix the owning doc,
  delete the question, and note both here.
- Nothing in P1 starts until the exit criteria at the bottom pass.

## Environment

Recorded 2026-08-02. Toolchain rows are **verified** — the native layer builds
and its tests pass on this machine. Everything below the toolchain is context
for the measurements that have not been taken yet.

| | |
|---|---|
| CPU | Intel Core i7-14700KF |
| GPU | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080, driver 32.0.16.1088 |
| RAM | 32 GB DDR5 |
| Motherboard | Gigabyte Z790M AORUS ELITE AX |
| Display | MSI MAG 274QF X24 — 2560×1440, 240 Hz |
| OS | Windows 11 Pro Insider Preview, build 26300.9032 |
| .NET SDK | 10.0.302 (pinned by `global.json`) — ✅ verified |
| MSVC | 19.51.36252, toolset 14.51.36231, VS 2026 Insiders — ✅ verified |
| Windows SDK | 10.0.22621.0 and 10.0.26100.0 installed — ✅ matches the TFM |
| CMake / Ninja | CMake 4.4.0, Ninja from the VS CMake component — ✅ verified |

| Launchers installed | Steam, Epic, itch.io, GOG Galaxy |

**Coverage gaps to state plainly rather than discover later:**

- **No AMD or Intel GPU.** The `18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS` §Capability matrix cannot be
  filled for those vendors here, and that matrix drives what the UI advertises
  as available. Mark them "untested", never `?`. AFMF (§9) is likewise
  unreachable — it is an AMD driver-side feature.
- **No integrated GPU** (the `KF` suffix means no iGPU) and exactly one adapter.
  Multi-GPU adapter-LUID selection — the `adapterLuid` field in the shm
  handshake, and the PDH instance filtering in `18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS` §L1 — cannot
  be exercised on this machine.
- **240 Hz display.** Useful to know when reading the ring-sizing argument in
  `04_CAPTURE`: 8192 records is ~16 s at 500 fps, so ~34 s at this refresh rate.
  Hook-overhead runs should uncap the frame rate rather than sit at 240.

### ✅ This machine is a realistic multi-overlay test bed — use it

Six machine-wide implicit Vulkan layers are already registered under
`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Khronos\Vulkan\ImplicitLayers`:

| Layer | Source |
|---|---|
| `VK_LAYER_VALVE_steam_overlay`, `VK_LAYER_VALVE_steam_fossilize` | Steam |
| `VK_LAYER_EOS_Overlay` | Epic Online Services |
| `GalaxyOverlayVkLayer` (+ `_DEBUG`, `_VERBOSE`) | GOG Galaxy |
| `VK_LAYER_OBS_HOOK` | OBS Studio |
| `VK_LAYER_RTSS` | RivaTuner Statistics Server |

**RTSS and the Steam overlay also hook D3D presentation in-process.** That makes
this machine the right place to answer two open questions, rather than
discovering them in a user's bug report:

- **§H7 — unhook clobbering.** `17_HOOK_ENGINE` §Unhooking restores the original
  vtable entry. If RTSS hooked the same slot after us, restoring it silently
  removes *their* hook. Test: hook with RTSS running, unhook, confirm RTSS still
  works. The compare-and-restore-only-if-unchanged fix is testable here today.
- **§H5 — proxy swapchains.** With this many overlays present, the swapchain the
  game presents through may not be the object our dummy-vtable probe patched.

Two more observations from `vulkaninfo` on this machine:

- **`HKCU` implicit layers: none.** All six above needed admin to register.
  `17_HOOK_ENGINE`'s choice of `HKCU` is the less common one and the better one.
- The loader warns that `GalaxyOverlayVkLayer` violates naming policy
  `LLP_LAYER_3`, and that OBS/RTSS declare API 1.3 against a 1.4 application.
  Both are mistakes we should not copy — see `17_HOOK_ENGINE` §Vulkan, where the
  layer name was corrected to `VK_LAYER_FRAMELEDGER_overlay` as a result.

**GOG fixture available:** `A Space for the Unbound - Prologue` at
`D:\another\gog\`, with a `goggame-1125815775.info` sibling — a real fixture for
the `05_DETECTION` §Platform signatures GOG path.

## 0 · Licence checks *(no hardware needed — do these first)*

Answers `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §M3, §M4. Both can invalidate a whole telemetry
layer, and neither needs a GPU.

### ✅ M4 · LibreHardwareMonitor MPL-2.0 Exhibit B — **CLEAR** (2026-08-02)

- Pinned version: `LibreHardwareMonitorLib` **0.9.6**, nuspec
  `<license type="expression">MPL-2.0</license>`, repo commit `3d331e33`.
- **The LICENSE file is not the evidence.** MPL-2.0's own text *contains*
  Exhibit B as a template (at lines 369–372 of the licence), so grepping the
  licence file finds the string in every MPL-2.0 project ever published and
  proves nothing. What matters is whether a **source file applies** the notice.
- Authenticated code search across the whole repository for
  "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses": **total_count = 1, and the single hit
  is `LICENSE` itself** — the template, not an applied notice.
- Every file we depend on carries **Exhibit A**, the permissive form:
  `Computer.cs`, `Sensor.cs`, `Gpu/NvidiaGpu.cs`, `Gpu/AmdGpu.cs` all begin
  "This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License,
  v. 2.0" with no Exhibit B sentence.
- The shipped 0.9.6 `.nupkg` was unpacked and scanned: **no Exhibit B notice in
  any of its 46 entries.**
- **Result: MPL-2.0 §3.3 Secondary Licenses applies → GPL-3.0 compatible.**
  L2 telemetry is safe to build on.

Two things this turned up that are *not* blockers but are now known:

- **The package ships no licence file at all** (`<license>` is an SPDX
  expression). MPL-2.0 §3.1 therefore makes shipping the text **our**
  obligation — `legal/licenses/mpl-2.0.txt` is now committed, and the
  `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES` release gate is a real requirement, not boilerplate.
- `Gpu/IntelIntegratedGpu.cs` has **no licence header** — an upstream
  inconsistency, not an Exhibit B problem. The repo-root LICENSE still governs.
  Worth re-checking on any version bump.

### ✅ M3 · NVAPI licensing and the import library — **CLEAR** (2026-08-02)

- Artifact: <https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvapi>, `main`.
- **The import library is in the repository**: `amd64/nvapi64.lib` and
  `x86/nvapi.lib` are tracked files, not a separate SDK download. That was the
  crux of the question — a `.lib` obtained from the NVIDIA SDK installer would
  have come with the SDK's own agreement instead.
- `License.txt` answers it in its first line, unusually explicitly:
  > `nvapi.lib and nvapi64.lib are licensed under the following terms:`
  followed by `SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT` and the standard MIT text. **The
  grant names the import libraries as its subject.**
- Headers carry their own `SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT` blocks
  (`nvapi.h`, `nvapi_lite_common.h`, `nvapi_interface.h` all verified).
- **Result: headers and `nvapi64.lib` are both MIT.** MIT is one-way compatible
  with GPL-3.0; vendoring is fine provided the notice is retained, which
  `tools/license-check.ps1` enforces. `legal/licenses/nvapi-MIT.txt` committed.
- Reflex / PC latency (FR-4.6, the latency tab, `sessions.latency_*`) is
  therefore reachable. Ordinal resolution stays rejected — it was only ever a
  workaround for a constraint that does not exist.

## 1 · Guard *(moved to first — `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §R1)*

Measured 2026-08-02, Windows 11 Pro Insider Preview 26300.9032, **unelevated**
(the default Agent under ADR-9). Probe: `src/native/tools/fl-probe-guard`,
running as ctest `fl_guard_apis`, so these are re-checked on every build rather
than being a one-off. It opens processes only with
`PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION | PROCESS_VM_READ` — the rights `19_SAFETY`
specifies — and never with `CREATE_THREAD | VM_OPERATION | VM_WRITE`.

### ✅ §S1 · Module enumeration on a suspended process — **it fails, it does not return empty**

```
suspended:          opened=1  enumerated=0  modules=0  enumErr=299 (ERROR_PARTIAL_COPY)
after ResumeThread: opened=1  enumerated=1  modules=9   (kernel32.dll present)
```

S1 predicted `EnumProcessModulesEx` "returns essentially nothing". **Measured, it
is sharper than that, and the difference is the whole point:** the call *fails*
with `ERROR_PARTIAL_COPY (299)`. It does not hand back a plausible empty success.

That is the good version of this news. An empty success is the dangerous shape —
it is exactly what `EnumDeviceDrivers` does, and it is what a guard reads as
"clean". An outright error cannot be mistaken for a clean scan by any caller that
checks the return value. So the guard's obligation here is narrow and explicit:

> **`ERROR_PARTIAL_COPY` means CANNOT DETERMINE, which means REFUSE.** Never
> "no modules found".

The blindness is the suspension and not our handle rights — the same target with
the same rights enumerates normally once resumed. §S1 is confirmed as a real
constraint on launch mode; what to *do* about it is still §S13(c).

### ✅ §S7 · WOW64 — the wrong filter under-reports, and silently

Live 32-bit target (`SysWOW64\cmd.exe`) enumerated from this x64 process:

| Filter | Modules |
|---|---|
| `LIST_MODULES_ALL` | **15** |
| `LIST_MODULES_DEFAULT` | 7 |
| `LIST_MODULES_32BIT` | 9 |
| `LIST_MODULES_64BIT` | 6 |

The default filter returns **less than half** the list, and returns it as a
*success*. A guard using the default would scan a 32-bit title, see 7 modules,
find no anti-cheat among them and report clean. `LIST_MODULES_ALL` is mandatory,
not a preference.

### ✅ Fail-closed inputs — "cannot inspect" is a distinguishable state

- **Protected process:** `OpenProcess` with the guard's own rights returns
  `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED (5)` for at least one process on this machine. So
  "I could not look" and "I looked and it was clean" are genuinely different
  values, and `19_SAFETY` §Elevated / protected targets is implementable.
- **Absent service:** `OpenServiceW` on a non-existent name returns
  `ERROR_SERVICE_DOES_NOT_EXIST (1060)` **specifically**, not a generic failure —
  which is the discrimination `19_SAFETY` relies on.
- **NOT MEASURED — the DENIED service branch.** A standard user holds
  `SERVICE_QUERY_STATUS` on the stock service set, so `ACCESS_DENIED` is not
  producible against real services here. It has to be driven from a unit-test
  fake. Recorded rather than implied: A5 does **not** cover it.

### ✅ Driver enumeration — the replacement measured against the fail-open

```
EnumDeviceDrivers                 ok=1  count=266  non-null bases=0  recoverable names=0
NtQuerySystemInformation(11)      STATUS_SUCCESS  78,744 bytes
                                  parsed=266  well-formed=266  resolvable-on-disk=257  ntoskrnl=yes
```

`EnumDeviceDrivers` reproduces its documented fail-open exactly: 266 drivers
reported, **zero** usable base addresses, **zero** recoverable names. The `Nt*`
route returns 266 real native paths.

**The fail-open is purely a function of elevation** — established by CI, which
runs elevated and failed this probe's original assertion:

| Configuration | `EnumDeviceDrivers` |
|---|---|
| unelevated (this machine, the ADR-9 default) | 266 drivers, **0** bases, **0** names |
| elevated (GitHub `windows-latest`) | 260 drivers, **260** bases, **260** names |

The API is not broken; it is broken *for standard users*. That is the
configuration ADR-9 makes the default, and it means anyone who tests this while
elevated sees a perfectly working call and concludes the defect is imaginary.

The probe's assertion was originally unconditional — "the `Nt*` route recovers
more identities" — which encoded one machine's configuration as a universal
fact and went red on CI for a correct reason. It is now elevation-aware: it
asserts the fail-open when unelevated, and when elevated says plainly that this
run **cannot** demonstrate it.

**The assertions here check content, not count — deliberately.** "266 distinct
non-empty strings" is *not* discriminating: the earlier two-byte offset bug
produced exactly that, and every string was garbage. So the probe asserts that
`ntoskrnl.exe` is present, that **every** path is a native path (`\SystemRoot\`
or `\??\`), and that 257 of them name files that actually exist on disk.

**Canary, run every build:** the same buffer is re-parsed with the historical
two-byte skew and the validator must reject it —
`well-formed=0, ntoskrnl=NO`, first entry `ystemRoot\system32\ntoskrnl.exe`.
A count check passes that. This one does not.

### ◐ §S19(b) · the signer half, measured before it is designed — `fl-probe-signer` (2026-08-27)

`ctest fl_signer_probe`, unelevated, dev box. §S19(b) asked for three answers before
any design is fixed; these are they. The analysis and the decision rows live in
`20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §S19(b) — what belongs here is what was **run**.

**Q1 · which route recovers an organisation.** Offline flags throughout
(`WTD_REVOKE_NONE | WTD_CACHE_ONLY_URL_RETRIEVAL`):

| Subject | embedded | catalog | `O=` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData.dll` (NuGet **6.0.0**) | **`ERROR_SUCCESS`** 3.61 ms | no catalog | `Microsoft Corporation` |
| `mskeyprotect.dll` | **`TRUST_E_NOSIGNATURE`** 0.23 ms | **`ERROR_SUCCESS`** 3.62 ms | `Microsoft Corporation` |
| `kernel32.dll` | `ERROR_SUCCESS` 4.69 ms | `ERROR_SUCCESS` 3.48 ms | `Microsoft Corporation` |

Full subject on every one: `C=US, S=Washington, L=Redmond, O=Microsoft Corporation,
CN=Microsoft Windows` — so `signerField: "O"` holds here, on a subject class it had
never been measured against.

**Two results that cut opposite ways.** The CI blocker is embedded-signed and verifies
offline, so the embedded half alone would clear that refusal. `mskeyprotect.dll` — the
module §S19(b) was *written about* — does not, and needs `CryptCATAdmin*`. The entry
predicted exactly that and it is now measured rather than argued.

**`kernel32.dll` carries BOTH**, which the probe was written assuming it would not.
"Catalog-signed" is not inferable from a file being a system binary; it is a per-file
measurement, which is why the probe reports both routes for every subject.

**And the module is not what §S19(b) says it is.** It calls the blocker *"a .NET
shared-framework assembly"*. `Microsoft.NETCore.App` 10.0.11 does not contain it. It
is a NuGet package assembly reached transitively as `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` →
`System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager` → `System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData`,
staged next to every test binary. **Dropping the reference means dropping the test
SDK**, so the cheapest-looking route out of the CI refusal is closed.

**Q2 · cost.** Cold 3.45 ms; warm mean of 20 = **3.54 ms**. There is no amortisation:
the second verification of the same file costs what the first did. Comfortable against
the 30 s re-scan **because the scan set is small** — three real titles produced no
fragment hit at all — and it stops being comfortable on a title that trips the fuzzy
tier repeatedly.

**Q3 · 🔴 `cryptnet.dll` is newly loaded UNDER THE OFFLINE FLAGS.** Census bracketing
the offline arm alone: `cryptnet.dll` appears. Nothing further appears once the
default `WTD_REVOKE_WHOLECHAIN` calls run, so this is not the default arm leaking into
the measurement.

> **The first version of this probe could not have told those apart.** It censused
> once at the top and once at the bottom with both arms in between, so the module
> appeared and the delta could not attribute it — a census spanning both arms of the
> comparison it exists to discriminate. Fixed before the run recorded above. Same
> shape as §S30's *"two numbers agreeing can be one number read twice"*, one layer
> down.

**Mapped is not transmitted, and this probe cannot close the gap.** `cryptnet.dll`
being loaded is the module that *would* make a request, not evidence that one was
made; there is no packet counter here. **The discriminating run is the owner's:
adapters disabled, same three subjects, compare verdicts.** A verdict that changes
offline retires the route, and §S19(b)'s row G2 says so before the run.

**Canary.** The probe's own unsigned executable returns `TRUST_E_NOSIGNATURE` and
yields no organisation — so a green result discriminates rather than merely running.
`fl-baseline-probe` was retired by exactly this class of test.

~~**Not measured here:** the CI leg (a different machine stages a different copy), and
the adapters-disabled leg. Both have pre-committed rows. An unrun leg is unrun.~~
**The CI leg, 2026-09-06** (the ctest printed nothing for eleven days; `ci.yml` now runs the
probe as a step): `windows-latest`, elevated. Blocker copy from the runner's NuGet cache,
6.0.0, embedded/offline `ERROR_SUCCESS` 3.47 ms, `O= Microsoft Corporation`, no catalog;
`mskeyprotect.dll` embedded `TRUST_E_NOSIGNATURE`, catalog `ERROR_SUCCESS`; `kernel32.dll`
both; cold 3.45 / warm 3.53 ms; `cryptnet.dll` newly loaded under the offline flags; canary
`TRUST_E_NOSIGNATURE`; *"G1 is a CANDIDATE"*. Rows G3, G4, G5 do not fire.
**The adapters-disabled leg, the owner's run, 2026-09-06** (dev box, elevated): every verdict
unchanged — `kernel32.dll` both `ERROR_SUCCESS`; `mskeyprotect.dll` embedded `TRUST_E_NOSIGNATURE`,
catalog `ERROR_SUCCESS`; the blocker embedded `ERROR_SUCCESS`, `O= Microsoft Corporation`, subject
now `CN=.NET` (the August copy read `CN=Microsoft Windows`; same `O=`); cold 2.14 / warm 2.15 ms;
`cryptnet.dll` mapped; canary `TRUST_E_NOSIGNATURE`. **Row G1 reads**; the bound decision is the
owner's before anything is built.

### Still open

- **§S13(c) — decision on launch-mode injection timing.** The measurement above
  makes the constraint precise but does not make the decision. Deliberately not
  taken here: quantifying the early-init data actually lost needs a title that
  loads a presentation runtime lazily, and the only local fixtures are
  `hook-harness` (creates D3D at startup) and a 2D GOG prologue. A number from
  those would not generalise, which is worse than recording it as unmeasured.
  *(2026-09-06: built as "inject late" — P1 item 2 — and the number now comes
  from every launched session, as `dxgiPresentsBeforeHook` plus the reported
  wait. `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §S1.)*

### ✅ Signer field for the unknown-but-suspicious heuristic — **`O=`, not `CN=`**

Measured 2026-08-02, Windows 11 26300, unelevated, via
`Get-AuthenticodeSignature` on real binaries present on this machine.

| Binary | `CN=` | `O=` |
|---|---|---|
| `kernel32.dll` | Microsoft Windows | Microsoft Corporation |
| `win32u.dll` | Microsoft Windows | Microsoft Corporation |
| `nvapi64.dll` | **Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility Publisher** | Microsoft Corporation |
| `nvlddmkm.sys` (the display driver) | **Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility Publisher** | Microsoft Corporation |
| `nvrla.exe` | NVIDIA Corporation | NVIDIA Corporation |
| `steam.exe` | Valve Corp. | Valve Corp. |

The `trustedSigners` list was a guess marked UNVERIFIED, and the schema's own
comment said the comparison was against **CN**. Measurement says that is the
wrong field: **WHQL re-signing replaces the CN with a Microsoft publisher
string**, so NVIDIA's own kernel driver does not present as NVIDIA. Under a
CN comparison the whole driver stack reads as untrusted, and paired with the
`guard`/`protect` name fragments that is a false-refusal path — the failure
direction that is safe for the user's account but destroys trust in the gate,
which is how someone ends up asking for the override CLAUDE.md rule 2 says does
not exist.

`signerField` is now a schema **`const": "O"`**, so switching it back requires
editing the schema. `"Microsoft Windows"` was dropped from `trustedSigners` — it
is a CN value and matches nothing under `O=`.

**Untested by decision (2026-08-02):** `Intel Corporation` and
`Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.`. No AMD or Intel GPU and no iGPU on this machine
(§Environment), and the owner elected to keep NVIDIA as the v1 focus rather than
chase them.

The WHQL finding above is what makes that cheap: both vendors' driver binaries
are WHQL-signed, so they present `O='Microsoft Corporation'` and are already
suppressed by the first entry. Only their **non-WHQL first-party** binaries
depend on these two strings, and a wrong string there fails **closed** — a
refusal, never a silent allow. Kept in the data, labelled untested, not
presented as measured.

## 2 · Vulkan layer passthrough *(moved earlier — §R2)*

Measured 2026-08-02 against **Vulkan loader 1.4.357** on Windows 11 26300,
unelevated, with `tools/vklayer-blastradius.ps1`. That script is the **only**
place the layer is registered; it registers under `HKCU`, runs `vulkaninfo`, and
unregisters in a `finally` block including on failure. Verified clean afterwards.

### ✅ `enable_environment` works, and it compares the VALUE

| Condition | Result |
|---|---|
| `FRAMELEDGER_ENABLE_VK_LAYER` unset | loader locates the manifest, **never maps the DLL** |
| set to `1` (the manifest's value) | `Insert instance layer` / `Inserted device layer` — mapped |
| set to `0` (non-matching) | **not** enabled — the loader compares the value, not mere existence |

The value comparison is the better of the two possible answers and was not
safe to assume: had the loader merely checked existence, a stray
`FRAMELEDGER_ENABLE_VK_LAYER=0` anywhere in a user's environment would have
enabled us machine-wide.

**Still a loading gate, not a security gate.** Anything running as the user can
set the variable. It shrinks the default blast radius from "every Vulkan process
on the machine" to "processes the Agent launched"; it does not authorise.

### 🔴 Declining `vkNegotiateLoaderLayerInterfaceVersion` CRASHES the host

The single most valuable thing this test found, and it was in code written the
same afternoon. The obvious-looking gate — "if this process is not in the
enable-list, return `VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED` from negotiation so the
loader skips us" — does **not** make loader 1.4.357 skip the layer. It
access-violates the application. Reproduced every time, with and without
`VK_LOADER_DEBUG`:

| Enable-list state (variable set) | `vulkaninfo` exit |
|---|---|
| file absent | `0xC0000005` |
| file present, this process not listed | `0xC0000005` |
| file present, this process listed | ok |

So that design would have crashed **every Vulkan application on the machine
outside our enable-list** — a far larger blast radius than the one §S2 exists to
reduce, and inflicted on applications that have nothing to do with FrameLedger.

**The rule that follows:** the layer always accepts negotiation and always
forwards. The enable-list decides what we *intercept*, never whether we *load*.
Being present and inert is cheap; being absent by erroring out is not something
this loader supports.

### Two false positives in the test itself, both corrected

Recorded because each would have reported a working gate as broken, and both are
the same shape as defects found elsewhere in this project:

1. **Discovery is not loading.** With the variable unset the loader still prints
   `Located json file "...\FrameLedger.VkLayer\VkLayer_..._overlay.json"`. A
   match on `FrameLedger.VkLayer.dll` hit that *path* — the manifest sits in a
   directory of that name.
2. **Availability is not loading.** `vulkaninfo`'s own report lists the layer by
   name, read from the manifest. That is the tool describing the system, not the
   loader mapping anything.

The unambiguous signal is the loader printing `Insert instance layer` /
`Inserted device layer` with our name and DLL path.

### ✅ `VK_ADD_IMPLICIT_LAYER_PATH` is honoured, and it needs no registry (2026-09-06, P1 item 3)

Measured against the same loader 1.4.357 with `vulkaninfo --summary` and `VK_LOADER_DEBUG=layer`: with
`VK_ADD_IMPLICIT_LAYER_PATH` pointed at the build tree's `FrameLedger.VkLayer` directory and
`FRAMELEDGER_ENABLE_VK_LAYER=1`, the loader prints `Insert instance layer "VK_LAYER_FRAMELEDGER_overlay"
(…\FrameLedger.VkLayer.dll)` and `Inserted device layer …` — the unambiguous signal above — with nothing
under `HKCU` or `HKLM`, and `vulkaninfo` exits 0 with the layer inert (no enable-list entry for it). The
first run's `grep … | head` cut the log before the `Insert` lines and read as "found, not inserted"; the
lines are at the instance-creation point, ~850 lines in. So the operator host launches Vulkan titles with
no registration at all, and the real-loader ctest (`fl_vklayer_real`) does the same: the harness's
`--vulkan` mode presented 241 frames in 4 s on a hidden 240-wide window and the layer recorded every one.

### ✅ On NVIDIA a Vulkan swapchain presents through DXGI — and the DXGI hook sees it (2026-09-06)

Found by the first end-to-end run of `launch` on the harness's `--vulkan` mode: the guard's poll saw
`dxgi.dll` + `d3d12.dll` (the fixture imports d3d11/dxgi; but the NVIDIA Vulkan ICD `nvoglv64` maps them
too) and injected the Overlay, whose `Present` hook then recorded **295 DXGI presents in 5 s with
`apiMask = D3D12` and DXGI's counter agreeing (248 samples, 0 unseen)** — the Vulkan swapchain's own
presents, made by the driver on an internal DXGI flip-model chain. So on this driver the injected Overlay
*can* measure a Vulkan title's presents; that is a driver property, not a portable one (AMD's and Intel's
WSI need not do it), which is why the layer stays the capture side. Two consequences landed: the
launch-mode guard now classifies **any** process that mapped `vulkan-1.dll` as the layer's, and the
harness's `--vulkan` mode maps the loader before anything else so the fixture looks like a real Vulkan
title to the first poll.

### ✅ The in-layer blocklist scan — §S2's second half

The layer scans its own process at init and goes fully passthrough on any hit,
using the same matcher and the same rules file as the injection guard. Verified
by `fl-probe-vklayer` (ctest `fl_vklayer_selfscan`), both directions:

```
[PASS] a clean process is NOT forced inert (so the blocked case below can mean something)
[PASS] the planted module is loaded into this process
[PASS] the self-scan now says STAY INERT - a blocklisted module was found
       after unload the scan says: may observe
```

The planted module is our own DLL copied under a blocklisted name
(`14_TESTING` §Integration tests: "a renamed harmless DLL, not real anti-cheat
software"). Proven red by making the matcher stop matching.

Two things worth keeping:

- **Both directions are asserted.** A self-scan that always answered "stay
  inert" would pass a one-sided test while silently disabling the layer
  everywhere — and would look exactly like a working gate.
- **The probe installs the seed rules when none exist**, then removes them.
  Without that it skipped on any machine that had not run the product, and a
  ctest that always skips is a gate that cannot fail. Installing them is the
  only option: there is deliberately no way to point the layer at a different
  rules file (§S3).

### Not yet done
- **Passthrough under a real Vulkan game**, alongside the six implicit layers
  already resident on this machine (§Environment). `vulkaninfo` proves
  load/no-load; it does not prove a real title still renders correctly with us
  in the chain.

## 3 · Hook viability on `hook-harness` only

**Already settled — the shared-memory layout.** ✅ `fl_shm.h` compiles under
MSVC 19.51 with `/W4 /WX`, every `static_assert` holds, and `fl-layout-dump`
output is **byte-identical between MSVC and gcc** across all four structs and
39 field offsets. All four regions are exactly 64 bytes with no implicit
padding, and the mapping is 512 KiB + 192 B of header at the default capacity.
This is what the corrected `07_IPC` layout was worth checking twice: the
earlier design put `FlControlBlock` at an offset that overlapped the header.

### ✅ H1 · `/guard:cf` with MinHook trampolines — **SAFE** (2026-08-02)

Probe: `src/native/tools/fl-probe-hookprofile`, built with the exact Overlay
flag set and run as ctest `fl_hook_profile`. MinHook v1.3.4, commit
`c3fcafdc`. Result: the indirect call from a `/guard:cf` module into MinHook's
runtime-allocated trampoline **succeeds**; `original=44 hooked=144`, and the
unhook path restores the original behaviour.

**A green probe is only worth what its setup proves, so the setup was verified
separately** rather than assumed — if CFG had not actually been enforcing, the
call would have succeeded for reasons that say nothing about H1:

| Evidence | Value |
|---|---|
| PE DLL characteristics | `Control Flow Guard` present |
| Guard CF function table | 84 entries |
| Guard Flags | `0x10014500` |
| Guarded indirect call sites in `.text` | **114** |
| `GetProcessMitigationPolicy` | `EnableControlFlowGuard = 1` |

Why it works: Windows marks memory allocated `VirtualAlloc(PAGE_EXECUTE_*)` as
a valid call target in the process CFG bitmap by default, so a trampoline is
callable without any `SetProcessValidCallTargets` dance.

⚠ **Measured with CFG strict mode OFF** (the probe reports it explicitly). A
host process that enables strict mode does not auto-validate dynamic code and
could still `__fastfail`. That is rare, and it is **not** catchable by
`FL_HOOK_GUARD` — see §H8. Treat it as a residual risk to watch for on real
titles, not as a solved problem.

### ✅ H3 · `-D_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=0` with `<atomic>` — **SAFE, with a sharp edge**

Compiles and runs under MSVC 19.51 with the full Overlay flag set, real
`fl_shm.h` included. `std::atomic_ref` is **lock-free at both 32- and 64-bit
widths** — the part that actually matters, since a non-lock-free atomic would
take a mutex and violate CLAUDE.md rule 5 in the present hook.

The sharp edge is what the define *does*, which is not "remove failure paths":

```
yvals.h:     #define _THROW(...) (__VA_ARGS__)._Raise()
             #define _RAISE(x)   _MSVC_STL_DOOM_FUNCTION(...)
__msvc_doom_core.hpp:  #define _MSVC_STL_DOOM_FUNCTION(mesg) __fastfail(5)
```

So a would-be exception becomes `__fastfail` — **an immediate, uncatchable
kill of the host game**. In an injected DLL that is arguably worse than an
exception, and SEH cannot intercept it (§H8 again).

It is safe here only because the hot path does not use throwing STL at all:
`<atomic>`, `<cstdint>` and `<type_traits>` contain **zero** throw-sites. That
makes the existing "no STL containers that allocate in hook paths" rule
load-bearing rather than stylistic — and arguably it is now a feature, since
violating it fails loudly in testing instead of propagating quietly.

### ◐ H2 · Hook installation under the loader lock — **safe path verified**

The deferred pattern holds: 20 MinHook enable/disable cycles (each suspending
every other thread to patch) while a worker thread ran **4,510**
`LoadLibrary`/`FreeLibrary` cycles. No deadlock, thread joined cleanly.

**Be precise about what this does not show.** It does not prove the naive
inline install deadlocks. A probe that deadlocks cannot report its own result,
and hanging CI to demonstrate a hazard we have already decided to avoid buys
nothing. So: the safe path is *verified*; the case against installing from
inside the `LoadLibrary` hook rests on the documented mechanism — suspending a
thread that holds the loader lock — and remains an argument, not a measurement.
H2 stays open in `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` for that reason.

### ✅ H4 · Vtable indices — **all three proved, and CI can prove them too**

`hook-harness --probe-vtable`, ctest `fl_vtable_indices`.

A vtable slot carries no identity, so "check that slot 8 is Present" is not a
question the runtime can answer — which is why the old "verified at runtime
against the dummy object" wording was unimplementable. What *is* answerable is
behaviour: patch the slot, call the method, see whether the detour ran.

| Slot | Claim | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 8 | `IDXGISwapChain::Present` | ✅ detour ran on `Present()` |
| 13 | `IDXGISwapChain::ResizeBuffers` | ✅ detour ran on `ResizeBuffers()` |
| 22 | `IDXGISwapChain1::Present1` | ✅ detour ran on `Present1()` |

Also confirmed: `IDXGISwapChain` and `IDXGISwapChain1` return the **same vtable
pointer** — one concrete object with the table extended past the base
interface — so slot 22 is reachable from either interface pointer. And slot 8
resolves inside a mapped image, with `dxgi.dll` loaded at the expected base.

**The CI half of §H4 is answered too.** The worry was that a hosted runner has
no GPU, no DXGI output and no interactive window station, so index probing
would be dev-machine-only and the test would have to be skipped. Two choices
remove that: **WARP** (software rasteriser, no adapter needed) and
**`CreateSwapChainForComposition`** (no `HWND` at all). Feature level `0xB000`
obtained headless. These run as ordinary ctests.

### ◐ H5 · Proxy swapchains — **less dangerous than assumed, not yet cleared**

`hook-harness --probe-proxy`, ctest `fl_proxy_swapchain`. The harness builds a
real forwarding `IDXGISwapChain` wrapper — what `sl.interposer` and ReShade
hand the application — and presents through it while our hook sits on the
**real** vtable.

```
real vtable  00007FFE3C87C688
proxy vtable 00007FF701716F20   (different, as expected — we never patched it)
proxy saw 1 present;  hook on the REAL vtable saw 1
```

**The hook still fires.** The proxy forwards with `real_->Present(...)`, an
ordinary virtual dispatch through the real vtable, so patching the real vtable
catches it one layer down. The naive fear — "a proxy has its own vtable, so we
miss the present entirely" — does not hold for a forwarding wrapper.

Why this is not yet a clearance for §H5:

1. **A forwarding proxy is the easy case.** DLSS-G does not merely forward; it
   presents *interpolated* frames the application never submitted. Whether
   those reach a real-vtable hook at all is the question that matters for the
   FG counting in `03_METRICS`, and this harness cannot answer it.
2. **We see the post-proxy call.** Parameters the proxy rewrote are what we
   observe, not what the game passed.
3. **A proxy that owns a different swapchain** — rather than wrapping ours —
   would still be invisible.

So: layering does not inherently break the strategy, which is genuinely good
news for the vtable approach. A real Streamline/DLSS-G title is still required
before §H5 closes.

### 🔴 Guard · The documented driver scan is blind unelevated — **fail-open found**

Measured 2026-08-02, Windows 11 26300, standard user (the default Agent
configuration under ADR-9). Independently reproduced twice.

| API | Result unelevated |
|---|---|
| `EnumDeviceDrivers` (what `19_SAFETY` specified) | `ok=True`, 258 drivers, **0 usable base addresses**, **1** recoverable name (`ntoskrnl.exe`) |
| `NtQuerySystemInformation(SystemModuleInformation)` | `STATUS_SUCCESS`, 258 modules, **258 distinct full paths**, real driver names legible |

The first one **succeeds while telling you nothing**. A guard built on it would
report "no anti-cheat driver present" on a machine running Riot Vanguard. That is
a fail-open in the hard gate, in the default configuration — the single most
serious defect found in this project so far, and it was in a shipped doc.

`19_SAFETY` §Pre-injection checks now specifies the `Nt*` route. Caveats that
must not be lost: the API is documented-as-unsupported, and
`RTL_PROCESS_MODULE_INFORMATION`'s layout is version-sensitive — my own quick
probe mis-computed the path offset by two bytes (`INDOWS\system32\...`), which is
exactly the class of error that must fail closed rather than silently match
nothing. Assert the struct offsets; treat any parse failure as *refuse*.

### ✅ H7 · Unhook does not clobber a later hooker — **closed**

`hook-harness --probe-unhook`, ctest `fl_unhook_preserves_foreign`. The foreign
hooker is simulated rather than depending on RTSS being installed, so the test
is deterministic and runs on CI instead of only on this machine.

```
[PASS] the foreign hook chained through ours (it saved our detour as its original)
[PASS] our unhook DECLINED to restore, because the slot is no longer ours
[PASS] the foreign hook is still installed - we did not silently remove it
[PASS] the foreign hook still fires after our unhook
[PASS] with the slot untouched, our unhook DOES restore
[PASS] the slot holds the pristine entry again
```

The mechanism is the interesting part: a later hooker saves **our detour** as
*its* original and chains through it, so an unconditional restore does not
"clean up after ourselves" — it deletes their hook, silently, and their overlay
stops working with no error anywhere. `17_HOOK_ENGINE`'s "cleaner uninstall"
claim was backwards and is corrected.

Both halves are asserted deliberately. A compare-and-restore that never restores
would pass a one-sided test and leave our detour permanently in every process.

### ✅ Per-present cost — **8.4 ns, against a 1,000 ns budget**

`hook-harness --probe-cost`. 20,000 presents × 5 runs, hooked and unhooked runs
**interleaved** so scheduler or thermal drift during the run is not attributed
to the hook, medians compared.

| | ns / present |
|---|---|
| unhooked | 317.9 |
| hooked | 326.3 |
| **delta** | **8.4** (budget 1,000 — NFR-1, `14_TESTING` §Hook overhead item 1) |

**Read this narrowly.** The detour is an atomic increment plus a call through the
saved pointer, i.e. the *floor* for any vtable hook — it bounds the mechanism,
not the product. The Overlay's real per-present cost is `14_TESTING` item 2,
measured on a real game, and that number is not this one.

Not registered as a ctest: a timing threshold on a shared CI runner fails for
reasons that have nothing to do with the code. Run it deliberately.

### ✅ The Overlay is a real capture side now — and what it does NOT measure (2026-08-05)

Recorded here retrospectively: PRs #40–#44 changed 8 files, all under `src/native/`,
and touched no documentation, so none of the below was written down at the time.

| | |
|---|---|
| Hooks installed | **three**, on the shared `dxgi.dll` class vtable: `Present` (8), `ResizeBuffers` (13), `Present1` (22) |
| Acquisition | throwaway WARP D3D11 device + `CreateSwapChainForComposition`, vtable read, dummy released — no HWND, runs headless |
| Ring | `Local\FrameLedger.Ring.<pid>`, DACL = current user's SID only, `ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS` refuses |
| ctests | **15**, incl. four `[inject][shm]` cases that inject the **real** Overlay into `hook-harness` cross-process |

**The `api` field, and a Windows API that does not do what the docs imply.**
`IDXGISwapChain::GetDevice` on a **D3D12** swapchain returns the **device**, not the
command queue — even though `CreateSwapChainForComposition` is *given* the queue. DXGI
resolves the queue to its owning device before storing it. The obvious implementation
(query the result for `ID3D12CommandQueue`) made every record from a real D3D12 target
come back `FL_API_UNKNOWN`. Both queries are kept: a DXGI that *did* hand back the queue
would otherwise regress to `UNKNOWN` silently.

**What the Overlay measures today is 8 of 23 record fields**, and the other 15 are
reported as *not measured* rather than defaulted:

| Written | Left at "not measured" |
|---|---|
| `qpc`, `frameIndex`, `presentFlags`, `syncInterval`, `api`, `swapchainId`, `outputW/H` | `renderW/H`, `upscaler`, `upscalerQuality`, `fgMode`, `fgEvaluations`, `rtFlags`, `dispatchRaysVolume`, `maxTraceRecursionDepth`, `psoCreatedThisFrame`, `vramUsedBytes`, `reflexLatencyUs`, `hdr` |

`measuredMask = FL_MEASURED_OUTPUT_RES` and `rtFlags = FL_RT_NOT_MEASURED` on every
record. Without those two bytes a present-only writer would assert "no upscaler, no
frame generation, no ray tracing" as *measured fact* ~118 times a second — `fg_factor`
1.0 (rule 6) and a definite RT `No` (rule 7) about a title nobody looked at.

**Two fields have a producer and no consumer, and one has neither:**
`FlWriterState::vramBudgetMb` is never written (no `QueryVideoMemoryInfo` hook);
`FlControlBlock::overlayEnabled` is never read; and `FlControlBlock::pauseRequested` is
never written by anything, while its only reader ~~is unreachable on any frame where
`guardTicks` changed~~.

> **Half of that last clause was fixed five lines below it, in the same PR, and this
> sentence was left in the present tense.** The reader is no longer unreachable — #46
> moved the deadline onto the watchdog thread, which removed the early return that
> jumped the pause check. What *is* still true is the first half: nothing writes
> `pauseRequested`. `ShmRingReader.SetPaused` is the intended writer and it has **no
> caller and no test at all** — three symbol sites in the whole tree, none of them a
> test — so the round trip has never been driven end to end even though both halves
> exist and the harness that would drive it is already staged.

**Two gaps found the same day by tracing call paths, and one is still open.**

- ✅ **Both runtime stops were unreachable in a non-presenting process**, and
  `pauseRequested` was unreachable on any frame where `guardTicks` changed — one root
  cause, `MayObserve()` having exactly one caller. Measured in both directions:
  `unhookRequested` against a live `--hold` target left `status` at `READY` through 10 s
  of polling, and a paused session leaked **12 records across 12 guard ticks, exactly one
  per tick** (`writeIndex` 9 → 21). Closed by the watchdog thread (§S25).
- 🔴 **The three-fault self-disable still has no test at all.** `NoteFault` discarded
  `MH_DisableHook`'s return and set no `g_observing`; that is fixed, without a regression
  net. The blocker is the vehicle — a fault seam compiled into a DLL that ships into
  games is rejected on sight, and the `VirtualProtectEx` alternative cannot locate the
  target's view base. Both approaches and their failure modes are written into
  `src/native/tests/CMakeLists.txt`.
- The 65-second value **in its real configuration** is also unverified: the stop is proven
  to fire, but a suite that runs on every build cannot wait 65 s, so what is tested is the
  mechanism, not the number.

### Still open in §3

Both remaining items need something this harness cannot synthesise:

- **§H2** — the deferred `LoadLibrary` install pattern is verified against heavy
  loader contention, but the case against the naive inline install still rests
  on the mechanism, not a measurement. Exercising it needs a real game that
  loads D3D12 lazily.
- **§H5** — a forwarding proxy does not defeat a real-vtable hook. DLSS-G
  presenting *interpolated* frames the application never submitted is the case
  that matters for FG counting, and it needs a real Streamline title.

Everything else in §3 is answered: H1, H3, H4, H7 and the per-present cost.

## 4 · Vendor symbol reality check

Resolve the **actual** exported names; `17_HOOK_ENGINE` records conventions, not
verified facts. A wrong name degrades silently to `unknown`, which reads as
"working, no upscaler detected" — the highest false-confidence risk in the spike.
Record the SDK version each name came from.

### ✅ Answered 2026-08-05 — `docs/vendor-exports.json`

Measured across **34 distinct modules in 162 files** from installed titles by
`tools/vendor-exports.ps1` (dumpbin over files on disk; nothing is loaded). The
map is committed rather than transcribed here, because a table copied by hand is
a second source that drifts from the first.

**The finding this item existed to produce** — the NGX parameter surface splits
into two hook classes, and only one half is an exported function:

| Module | Parameter **accessors** | Parameter-object **factories** |
|---|---|---|
| `sl.common.dll` (Streamline) | **yes**, all 16 | yes |
| `nvngx.dll` / driver-store `_nvngx.dll` | **no** | yes (D3D11/12/VK/CUDA) |
| `nvngx_dlss.dll`, `_dlssg`, `_dlssd` | no | no |

Streamline-shimmed titles (9 of those installed here) expose
`NVSDK_NGX_Parameter_SetI/SetUI` as ordinary exports. NGX-direct titles do not:
the accessors are function pointers inside the object the factories return, so
there is no symbol to hook. `17_HOOK_ENGINE` §The NGX parameter surface carries
the decision and its CLAUDE.md rule-4 justification.

**Not gated.** Nothing cross-checks `17_HOOK_ENGINE`'s symbol table against the
JSON, so they can drift — that gate belongs with the PR that adds the feature
hooks, where a failing row would mean something. The map is also one machine on
one driver version, and the JSON says so in its own `$comment`.

## 5 · Proxy swapchains *(§H5)*

### ✅ The shared-vtable premise, proven both directions — ctest `fl_vtable_identity_control`

`fl-probe-interposer` (2026-08-05). Two composition swapchains created by
independent routes through the real `dxgi.dll` report **one vtable**
(`0x…842BC688`, stable across runs), and a different interface reports a
different one. The second half is what makes the first readable: a comparison
that has never been shown to detect a *difference* carries no information when it
reports "same".

This is the property `17_HOOK_ENGINE` §`swapchainId` and the whole vtable-hook
design rest on, and it is now a ctest rather than a one-off measurement — if it
ever stops holding, the build fails instead of a game discovering it.

### ◐ The interposer question is NOT answered, and the first run of the probe answered it wrongly

Measured against **Cyberpunk 2077** (`sl.interposer.dll` 2.7.1) and **Black Myth:
Wukong** (2.7.4), loaded into our own process — no game running, no injection, no
guard.

| | |
|---|---|
| The interposer loads standalone and exports `CreateDXGIFactory2` | its address differs from `dxgi.dll`'s, so we are genuinely on its code path |
| Swapchain vtable through the interposer | **identical** to the real one |
| **Factory** vtable through the interposer | **also identical** |
| `sl.*` plugins mapped afterwards | **none** — only `sl.interposer.dll` itself |

**That last row is why the first three mean nothing, and the probe was changed to
say so.** As first written it printed *"VERDICT: THE SAME — a vtable-slot present
hook DOES catch presents made through the Streamline interposer"* for both
titles. It was a confident wrong answer. Streamline forwards straight to
`dxgi.dll` until `slInit()` has run and a feature is loaded, so what was measured
is that **passthrough is passthrough**. The tell was in the output the whole
time: a genuinely interposing Streamline cannot leave the *factory* vtable
unwrapped, because wrapping the factory is how it reaches the swapchain.

The probe now enumerates its own loaded modules and refuses to render a verdict
when no plugin is mapped, exiting **2 = inconclusive**. Same discipline as the
guard's tri-state collectors: "could not look" must not read as "looked and it
was clean".

**What answering it actually needs, stated rather than left to be rediscovered:**
`slInit()`, whose `sl::Preferences` argument is vendor ABI — i.e. the licence
question `legal/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` settles for Intel IGCL ("re-declaring the
API by hand is explicitly NOT an approved workaround") and which is unanswered
for NVIDIA. So §H5 case 3 is **blocked on a licence decision, not on hardware**,
which is a different and more tractable blocker than "needs a real DLSS-G
session". The alternative route is unchanged: observe a real title once the
Overlay has a present hook.

**What is bounded now:** the risk is confined to titles that go through the
Streamline interposer. NGX-direct titles call `nvngx*.dll` and never wrap the
swapchain, so the vtable premise is not in question for them.

## 6 · RT detection

### ✅ The pre-flight, before a single hook was written — 2026-08-20

`hook-harness --probe-d3d12-vtable` (ctest `fl_d3d12_vtable_indices`) and
`--probe-dxr` (ctest `fl_dxr_probe`), on this machine: Windows 11 Insider 29648,
RTX 5080, MSVC 14.51.

**Adapters, and all three can ray-trace.**

| Adapter | D3D12 | `RaytracingTier` |
|---|---|---|
| NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 | yes | **12** (`TIER_1_1`) |
| Microsoft Basic Render Driver | yes | **12** |
| WARP (software) | yes | **12** |

So `HANDOFF` item 4's *"check first whether WARP on the CI runners supports DXR"*
is answered **yes on this machine's WARP**, which means a DXR fixture is not
condemned to a GPU box. CI still has to answer for its own `d3d10warp.dll`; the
tier is a property of that binary, and `fl_dxr_probe` prints it on every run.

**Slot indices, proved by behaviour on BOTH list types.** Slot 72 is
`BuildRaytracingAccelerationStructure` and slot 76 is `DispatchRays`: patched,
called by name through the interface, detour ran, slots restored and the restore
asserted. 60 consecutive runs of each probe, zero failures.

### 🔴 `Reset()` moves `DispatchRays` into the vendor driver, and the first version of the hook never fired

**THE FIRST THREE ANSWERS WERE MEASURED ON THE WRONG OBJECT, and two of them were
wrong because of it.** The probe originally read the vtable off a **freshly
created** command list and compared vtable ARRAYS. A game's list is Reset every
frame, and the Overlay patches the FUNCTION a slot points at rather than the slot
— so both choices measured something no hook depends on. Corrected here rather
than quietly re-run: the wrong answers are the useful part.

| Question | measured on a **reset** list, comparing **functions** |
|---|---|
| two DIRECT lists, one device | **same functions** — one inline patch covers every list. Their vtable ARRAYS differ (per-object after Reset), which is why a *slot* patch would have to be repeated and a *function* patch does not |
| a command allocator (the control) | different, as it must be |
| DIRECT vs COMPUTE | **same functions** — slot 72 `D3D12Core.dll` in both, slot 76 `nvwgf2umx.dll` in both. One detour per method covers both list types |
| a WARP list vs a hardware list | **DIFFERENT** — slot 76 is `nvwgf2umx.dll` on the RTX 5080 and `D3D12Core.dll` on WARP |
| a fresh list vs a reset list | **DIFFERENT** — slot 76 moves from `D3D12Core.dll` to `nvwgf2umx.dll`; slot 72 stays in `D3D12Core.dll` |

**The failure this produced, before the fix.** The Overlay read its targets off an
unreset throwaway list, so it hooked `D3D12Core.dll`'s `DispatchRays` — a function
no title on this GPU ever calls, because the first `Reset` hands the method to the
driver. The hook installed, published `FL_HOOK_RT_DISPATCH`, and never fired. The
injected fixture caught it exactly: `withAsBuild = 60`, **`withDispatch = 0`**,
`hooks = RT_DISPATCH | RT_AS_BUILD` — a mask bit with nothing behind it, which is
the honesty failure the whole entitlement machinery exists to prevent.

**Why one hook worked and the other did not, which is what made it hard to read.**
`BuildRaytracingAccelerationStructure` stays in `D3D12Core.dll` across the swap, so
the AS-build hook fired from the first run. A pair where one half works reads as a
bug in the other half's *detour*, not in the *acquisition* both share.

**The fix is one call**: put the throwaway list through the same lifecycle a game's
list goes through — `Close()`, `Reset()` — before reading its vtable. `--probe-dxr`
Q5 now prints the module on each side of the Reset, so a runtime that stops
swapping, or starts swapping the other slot, says so rather than being discovered
by a silent zero on a real title.

**And Q4 stops being permissive.** With the correction, a WARP list and a hardware
list resolve `DispatchRays` to *different* functions, so a throwaway-**device**
acquisition would silently miss every call on an NVIDIA GPU. The Overlay takes its
targets off a list created on the **game's own device** — which was already the
design, for the unrelated reason that this machine lost WARP's D3D12 path to an
Insider build for a fortnight (§Traps), and now has a second reason that is about
correctness rather than availability.

**Bundles are not a further case**, and this is a documented API constraint rather
than something measured here: `D3D12_COMMAND_LIST_TYPE_BUNDLE` does not permit
`DispatchRays`. Stated as an inherited claim so the next reader knows which of
these lines came from a run.

### ✅ Both hooks, proved by injection — 2026-08-20

`ctest fl_guard`, the case *"the injected Overlay records ray-tracing work, and an
AS-build-only title is not a negative"*. Two harness modes that differ by **one
recorded call**, sharing their acceleration structure, state object, swapchain and
loop, so any difference in the record is attributable to that call:

| Mode | records | `FL_MEASURED_RT` | `AsBuildObserved` | `DispatchObserved` | `dispatchRaysVolume` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--hold-presenting-dxr` | 60 | every one | 60 | ≥ 8 | exact multiple of 64×32×1 |
| `--hold-presenting-rayquery` | 60 | every one | 60 | **0** | **0** |

The rayquery arm is what makes `03_METRICS:226` falsifiable instead of a sentence:
a writer with only the `DispatchRays` hook sees **nothing** there, and its silence
is indistinguishable from a real negative — `rtTier` is 12, the mask bit is set,
evidence is zero, and the `No` branch fires about a title that ray-traces every
frame. **It does not run a RayQuery shader**, and does not need to: the claim under
test is "AS-build catches a title `DispatchRays` misses", and the absence of a
dispatch is what tests it.

`DispatchRays` also needs a **bound raytracing state object** to be RECORDED at
all: measured 2026-08-20, it access-violates inside D3D12Core with no state object
set, with a well-formed shader table and with a zeroed one alike. That is why the
fixture carries a 1.2 KB DXIL raygen library (`dxr_raygen.hlsl`, compiled by hand
and checked in with its command line).

### ✅ Both hooks against four real titles' own settings menus — 2026-08-20

§8 carries the five captures in full. What belongs here is the RT half:

- **`Yes` twice, `No` twice, every verdict agreeing with the game's own menu.** Cyberpunk with
  path tracing on and Wukong at RT High both read `Yes`; Rune Factory, whose menu has no
  ray-tracing option, and Cyberpunk with every RT option switched off both read **`No`** — the
  branch that had never been reachable in this project.
- **`rt_frame_pct` reads 25.0% at ×4 on two titles**, which is the falsifier `03_METRICS`
  §RT/PT/RR pre-committed. It did not fire.
- **`faults = 0` on every run**, with both detours on the render thread of titles running at up
  to ~950 presents/second.
- **The dispatch extent is exact.** Alan Wake 2: `4,913,280` rays per RT-active present, and
  `3 × 1706 × 960` is `4,913,280` — three rays per render pixel, against a render resolution
  the menu states outright.

### Still open in §6
- The same measurements on an **AMD or Intel** GPU. Every vendor-specific result
  above is one driver's: `nvwgf2umx.dll` takes `DispatchRays` and leaves

  them the same way — or leaves either in `D3D12Core`:

## 7 · First real injection *(requires the guard, §1)*

### ✅ Done — 2026-08-03

- **Title:** Lies of P (Steam, Unreal, x64, single-player, no anti-cheat).
  Injected into `LOP-Win64-Shipping.exe`, the presenting process — `LOP.exe` at
  the install root is a shim and was left alone.
- **`/MT` DLL loaded without incident: yes.** `FlGuardEvaluate` → `Allow`;
  `FlGuardedInject` → `Allow`; `FrameLedger.Overlay.dll` present in the target on
  re-enumeration (143 → 144 modules), mapped at `0x7FFA60340000`, 820 KB.
  Afterwards: alive, responding, **103.6 s of CPU over 6 s wall-clock** across
  180 threads — still rendering, not stalled.
- **It also shut down cleanly with the Overlay still mapped.** `WM_CLOSE`, and
  both `LOP-Win64-Shipping.exe` and the `LOP.exe` shim exited on their own; no
  hang, no crash dialog, no orphan. Worth stating because process exit runs
  `DllMain(DLL_PROCESS_DETACH)` on a loader-locked thread, which is the one
  lifecycle path a `/MT` static-CRT DLL is most likely to fail on, and it is not
  exercised by `hook-harness` — the harness is killed, not closed. **Nothing is
  hooked yet**, so this clears the loader, not the unhook path; P1's fault
  policy and unhook still need the same check once `Present` is hooked.
- Reached through the shipped C ABI (`FrameLedger.Guard.dll`), so there was no
  path that skipped the gate. There is no injector CLI and there will not be —
  §S9 closed that as a design decision, not as a gap.

**The three refusals that came first are the valuable part.** Every one was a
real defect, and none would have surfaced without a real machine and a real
title:

| Attempt | Verdict | What it actually was |
|---|---|---|
| Deadly Heart Gambit, no rules installed | `RulesUnreadable` | Correct. A machine that has never run the product refuses by default. |
| Same, rules installed | `BlockedService` `EasyAntiCheat_EOS` | **Defect.** A Stopped/Manual service installed by an unrelated EOS game made the guard refuse *every process on the machine*, `explorer.exe` included. Fixed: present now means running. |
| Same, from the launching shell | `SuspiciousUnsigned` `FrameLedger.Guard.dll` | **Defect, open.** Our own DLL trips our own `guard` name fragment. See below. |
| Same, from a non-ancestor process | `Allow` → injection refused | Correct, and now legible: **Deadly Heart Gambit is x86**, and the Overlay is x64-only. This fills `14_TESTING`'s manual-matrix row for a 32-bit title. |

### ✅ Closed — the guard refused itself in launch mode *(fixed 2026-08-04)*

Isolated cleanly on the same title, same machine, same rules:

| Evaluating process | Verdict |
|---|---|
| An **ancestor** of the game, with `FrameLedger.Guard.dll` loaded | `SuspiciousUnsigned` |
| Not an ancestor | `Allow` |

§S16 walks the game's ancestors up to the first platform launcher. The name
`FrameLedger.Guard.dll` contains `guard`, which is one of the heuristic's
`nameFragments`, and the signer half is not wired — so an unchecked signature is
untrusted by definition and the pair refuses.

**In launch mode the Agent *is* the parent** (`04_CAPTURE` §Launch mode) **and
hosts that DLL**, so every launch-mode injection would refuse. Attach mode is
unaffected, which is why the run above succeeded. Not fixed here; recorded as its
own item.

Note the project also ships **unsigned** (CLAUDE.md rule 9 and the pinned-stack
Packaging row — *not* `12_BUILD`, which this line used to cite and which contains
no signing text at all), so wiring the signer check would not rescue our own
binaries. Whatever the fix is, it cannot be "sign it".

#### ✅ Fixed and re-measured on three real titles — 2026-08-04

The arrangement was reproduced end to end rather than argued: a stand-in for the
Agent, built into `FrameLedger.Agent`'s own output directory **beside a real
`FrameLedger.Guard.dll`**, loads that DLL and then **launches the game**. So our
binary is the game's ancestor and carries the module whose name trips the guard's
own `guard` fragment — the 2026-08-03 shape, with a real title on the other end.

Evaluate only. `FlGuardedInject` was never called; nothing was injected into any
game.

| Title | Store / engine | Pre-fix (`bb0da0a`) | Post-fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deadly Heart Gambit | Steam / Unity, x86 | `SuspiciousUnsigned` — `FrameLedger.Guard.dll` | **`Allow`** |
| Lies of P | Steam / Unreal, x64 | `SuspiciousUnsigned` — `FrameLedger.Guard.dll` | **`Allow`** |
| Alan Wake 2 | Epic / Northlight | `SuspiciousUnsigned` — `FrameLedger.Guard.dll` | **`Allow`** |

Two things about the harness that are worth keeping, because both produced a
confident wrong answer first:

- **The evaluator must not be in the target's ancestor chain.** The first attempt
  used `Start-Process`, so the evaluating process — which had P/Invoked into the
  guard and therefore carried `FrameLedger.Guard.dll` itself — was the game's
  grandparent. Post-fix still refused, and it looked like the fix did not work.
  It did; the refusal was about the evaluator, whose image is in
  `C:\Program Files\PowerShell`, correctly *not* ours. The script now walks the
  chain and asserts the evaluator is absent from it before reporting.
- **Launching the stand-in through WMI put `WmiPrvSE.exe` in the scan set**,
  which an unelevated guard cannot open — a correct `ProcessUnreadable` about
  something irrelevant. Orphaning it via `cmd /c start` terminates the ancestor
  walk at the stand-in instead.

An earlier iteration also stopped at `PreScanFailed` because the target was
`cmd.exe` and check 4 then tried to list `System32`. That is check 4 answering
correctly about the wrong directory — noted because it is the shape of a green
that means nothing.

#### ◐ The same tier matches benign system DLLs — measured twice, and the second time changed the conclusion

**First measurement (2026-08-03), unelevated, Windows 11 26300:** 331 processes,
0 access-denied, 4 modules matching the `protect` fragment, none anti-cheat.
Recorded as "a game that loads `mskeyprotect.dll` is refused today, in the mode
that ships", and used to justify wiring the signer half next.

**Re-measured 2026-08-04 on the same machine, and neither half of that survived:**
290 processes, 0 inaccessible, **3 hits**.

| Process | Module | Signature type | `O=` | Suppressed by a file-choice signer check? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `WidgetService` | `mskeyprotect.dll` | **Catalog** | Microsoft Corporation | **No — no embedded signature to read** |
| `ProtonVPN.Client` | `System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData.dll` | Authenticode | Microsoft Corporation | Yes |
| `Malwarebytes` | `Malwarebytes.Protection.Interop.dll` | Authenticode | **Malwarebytes Inc** | **No — publisher absent from `trustedSigners`** |

Two findings, both of which change what gets built:

- **The proposed fix addresses one case of three.** The signer table in §1 above
  was taken with `Get-AuthenticodeSignature`, which consults the CatRoot
  catalogs — so it reports `O=` for files that carry no embedded signature at
  all. `mskeyprotect.dll`, `kernel32.dll` and `nvapi64.dll` are all
  `SignatureType=Catalog`. A native `WinVerifyTrust` with `WTD_CHOICE_FILE`,
  which is what "wire `IsTrustedSigner`" means in every prior note, recovers
  nothing for them; `IsTrustedSigner(nullptr)` is false by contract and the
  refusal survives. Catalog verification needs `CryptCATAdminAcquireContext2` /
  `CalcHashFromFileHandle` / `EnumCatalogFromHash` + `WTD_CHOICE_CATALOG`.
  **A measurement taken with a convenient tool does not license a design built on
  a different one.**
- **"Refused today, in attach mode" is not supported.** All three hits are
  desktop processes — a widget host, a VPN client, an AV service. None can enter
  a game's scan set: `EnumerateScanSetImpl` stops the ancestor walk at the first
  `IsPlatformLauncher` match, and that list includes `explorer.exe`,
  `services.exe` and `svchost.exe`. Three real titles (§8) were scanned with no
  fragment hit at all.

~~The defensible claim: **the `protect` fragment matches a benign, widely-loaded
Microsoft system DLL, and has not been shown to match inside any game's scan
set.** A game process loading DPAPI/CNG for save encryption or a launcher token
would trip it — plausible, unmeasured, and worth fixing; not a live incident.~~

§S19(b) is therefore **deferred with a written rationale** rather than scheduled
next. Before any design is fixed, `fl-probe-signer` should answer three things on
this machine, in the shape `fl-probe-guard` established: whether
`WinVerifyTrust(WTD_CHOICE_FILE)` recovers `O=` from a catalog-signed system
binary; what one full `Evaluate()` costs with catalog verification across a real
scan set, against the 30 s re-scan; and whether `WTD_REVOKE_NONE` +
`WTD_CACHE_ONLY_URL_RETRIEVAL` emits network traffic — the default
`WTD_REVOKE_WHOLECHAIN` performs CRL/OCSP fetches, which breaks **NFR-10
offline-first** as well as CLAUDE.md rule 8, from inside the hard gate.

> **THE PROBE NOW EXISTS AND HAS ANSWERED ALL THREE, 2026-08-27 — see the
> §S19(b) subsection in §1 above.** This paragraph is kept because the QUESTIONS it

> why the discriminating run is the owner's.

Also measured: **`gameguard` could never fire.** The match is a case-insensitive
substring and `guard` is a substring of `gameguard`, so the shorter token always
won first. A shipped rule incapable of firing independently, inside the safety
gate.

### The guard against a RUNNING title, 2026-08-15

The precondition every verification run below depends on, and it had never been
measured against a live process. Everything earlier in this file evaluated the
guard in **launch-mode arrangement** — our binary as the game's ancestor,
evaluate-only, nothing injected — or scanned files on disk. Neither answers the
question the capture path actually asks: *does the guard allow this title while it
is playing?*

**Alan Wake 2, pid 40424, running, `FlGuardEvaluate` → `Allow`.** Reason 0, empty
family, empty signal. Rules resolved from
`C:\Users\Anon\AppData\Local\FrameLedger\rules\detection-rules.json`, 24 reason
codes.

**Evaluate only. Nothing was injected**, and no consent record exists for this
title — `FlGuardEvaluate` is the read-only half of the ABI and takes no injection
rights.

Why it needed doing at all: the installed-corpus scan (§Environment) is a **file**
scan, and the guard scans **loaded modules of the live process** plus the target's
ancestors (§S16). A title clean on disk can still load an anti-cheat module at
runtime, and Alan Wake 2 is launched by the Epic client, which is in the scan set.
Had this refused, every per-title row in §8 would have been undischargeable and the
upscaler/FG/RT work would have had no oracle to verify against.

**One title, one moment.** This is not a statement about Cyberpunk 2077, about
Alan Wake 2 on another machine, or about the same machine after a launcher update.
It is the one measurement that was missing before the feature hooks had anywhere
to prove themselves.

**The first row, and it is one row.** Read the legend before the marks: ✅ measured and
correct against the title's own settings; ❌ measured and **wrong**; ⬜ honestly absent — no
producer, or the title does not expose it on the route we take.

Conditions: Cyberpunk 2077 in combat, 40 s bounded capture, **10,169 presents, 0 gaps, 0
dropped**, 254.82 displayed FPS, `apiMask` = D3D12, hooks `Present | UpscalerIdentity |
UpscalerParams`. Consent granted by the operator; the guard evaluated `Allow`. A second run
minutes earlier gave 11,108 presents with the same shape.

**Render → output is the one that lands, and it lands exactly.** `UserSettings.json` records
`DLSS = Balanced` at `2560x1440`; Balanced is 0.58, so 2560 × 0.58 = 1484.8 and
1440 × 0.58 = 835.2. The writer said **1485×835**. This is the first of exit criterion 1's
five values measured correctly from a real game.

**Quality `0xFF` is a measurement of the TITLE, not a gap in the code.** Cyberpunk sets its
preset out of band through `slDLSSSetOptions` and never chains `sl::DLSSOptions` into
`slEvaluateFeature`'s `inputs`. The only route that would reach it is the one
`docs/HANDOFF.md` §2b refuses on five grounds. So **the `DLSSOptions` half of the inputs walk
has a ZERO hit rate on this title** — the unknown §2b flagged as its largest, now measured
once. `0xFF` is the defined "a hook ran and could not tell", and it is true.

**Upscaler `Unknown` is WRONG, and is filed as §S30 rather than reported as a result.**
Cyberpunk is running DLSS. Every one of the 2,461 params-carrying presents decoded to
`UNKNOWN`. Honest — it is never `NONE` — and not the answer the exit criterion asks for.

**One number fell out that this run was not designed to take.** The params bit appeared on
2,461 of 10,169 presents (24.2%), i.e. **10,169 / 2,461 = 4.13**; the earlier run gave
11,108 / 2,696 = **4.12** independently. `UserSettings.json` says
`DLSS_MultiFrameGeneration = x4`. That is `fg_factor` matching its oracle to two significant
figures **before the frame-generation producer exists** — strong support for counting
evaluations directly (the 2026-08-14 owner ruling) rather than deriving generated frames from
a multiplier. **It is not a measurement of `fgEvaluations`**: it uses the params bit as a
proxy for "an SL feature evaluated during this present", and item 3's producer must reproduce
it directly before the number may be published.

**Two operational facts, learned by hitting them.** The lazy feature-hook install costs the
opening **~1.15 s** of every session — 292 of 10,169 records lack the `Upscaler` bit, and 288
of 11,108 in the other run, both matching the 1 Hz watchdog. And **a game launch yields ONE
capture**: when the host detaches, the Overlay stops receiving guard ticks and self-unhooks at
the 65 s deadline exactly as `19_SAFETY` specifies, so the next attach correctly reports
`SupervisionLost` rather than a live session. The Overlay does not re-arm.

### ✅ The baseline exists — `fl-baseline-probe` (2026-08-03)

**§M9's problem is closed.** `15_ROADMAP` required comparing against "the old
file/module-based detection", which does not exist in this repository, so item 4
had no left-hand side and ADR-7's founding claim was unfalsifiable. The baseline
is now a real tool rather than a memory of one.

- **Baseline used instead:** `src/native/tools/fl-baseline-probe`, reading the
  `capabilities` group of `rules/detection-rules.json` (`rulesVersion 2026.08.1`,
  **7 capabilities**: DLSS, DLSS-G, Ray Reconstruction, Streamline, FSR, XeSS,
  XeSS-FG). It answers two questions per capability — is it **on disk** beside
  the game, and is it **loaded** right now.
- It **reuses the guard's module enumerator** (`SystemSources().EnumerateModules`,
  `LIST_MODULES_ALL`, §1) rather than carrying a second walk, so the baseline and
  the product see the same module list — including the same fail-closed
  behaviour. An `INCOMPLETE` or `FAILED` scan is printed as such and must never
  be read as "no capability loaded".
- It reads the capability data in its **own translation unit**. The guard's jsmn
  parser deliberately reads only the `anticheat` subtree, and teaching it a group
  the hard gate does not need would spend the gate's parse budget (§S17) on
  inference data.
- **Proven both directions**, ctest `fl_baseline_probe`: a clean process reports
  nothing loaded, a planted module *is* detected, and the answer flips back after
  unload rather than latching. The planted module is **our own
  `FrameLedger.Guard.dll` copied under a capability name** (`14_TESTING`
  §Integration tests) — no NVIDIA, AMD or Intel binary is shipped, downloaded or
  executed, and none needs to be installed for the test to mean something.
- Proven red twice: a probe that never reports `loaded`, and findings that latch
  across scans.

### 🔴 The comparison item 4 asks for cannot be a percentage

**Stated before any README wording is drafted, because the roadmap's phrasing
("quantify the improvement") invites a number that would have to be invented.**

Item 4 asks the baseline about upscaler identity, quality preset, render vs
output resolution, and DLSS-G activity. The baseline can answer **none of them**:

| Item 4 asks | Baseline answers | Hooks answer |
|---|---|---|
| upscaler identity | *ships / loads* DLSS — a different statement (`05_DETECTION`:10) | measured |
| quality preset | **nothing** | measured |
| render vs output resolution | **nothing** | measured |
| DLSS-G active | *ships / loads* DLSS-G | measured |
| engine · platform · version | detected | not measured by hooks at all |

A loaded `nvngx_dlss.dll` means the title *can* use DLSS this run. It does not
say whether DLSS is on, at what preset, or at what render resolution — and a
title that ships the DLL and has it disabled in the menu is indistinguishable
from one using it.

So the honest form of ADR-7's claim is **"the baseline cannot answer four of
these five questions at all"**, not "N% more accurate". That is both stronger and
checkable. **Owner decision, recorded here rather than assumed.**

- **Quantified improvement (belongs in the README):** *not a percentage — see
  above. Fill the per-title table once an offline title is chosen.*

### ✅ The static half, measured on three real titles (2026-08-03)

First run of the detector against real installs. **It failed on three of four
cases, and the failures were the point** — both were real defects that only a
real layout could expose.

| Title | Store / engine | On disk (scanned by hand) | Detector, after the fixes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deadly Heart Gambit | Steam / Unity | `UnityPlayer.dll`, `steam_api.dll` | `unity` **2022.3.32.13119501**, `steam` |
| Lies of P | Steam / Unreal | `nvngx_dlss.dll`, `amd_fidelityfx_dx12.dll`, `steam_api64.dll` | `unreal`, `steam`, **dlss + fsr** |
| Alan Wake 2 | Epic / *(Northlight)* | `EOSSDK-Win64-Shipping.dll`, 6 NGX/Streamline DLLs | `epic`, **dlss + dlss_g + dlss_rr + streamline** |

Alan Wake 2 reports **no engine**, correctly: Remedy's Northlight is not in the
rules table, and "no rule matched" is a real answer rather than a failure. Lies
of P reports no engine *version* because its `LOP-Win64-Shipping.exe` carries no
`ProductVersion` for the regex to read — also honest.

**None of the three carries anti-cheat**, so all three are legitimate candidates
for the first real injection (item 2).

#### 🔴 Defect A — a depth cap that made the detector useless

`GameFileProbe` capped the walk at depth 4. Measured real depths: **Deadly Heart
Gambit 6, Alan Wake 2 5, Lies of P 9.** Every real game exceeded it.

Worse than the cap was what incompleteness *meant*: an unfinished walk marked
`FileExists`, `SiblingGlob` and `DirExists` all uncollected, so **every**
file-based signal became `Unknown`, the engine walk stopped at its first rule,
and nothing was ever identified. Failing safe is right; failing safe on every
input is not working.

Fixed by separating the two questions. A file the walk **listed** is a file that
is there, however early it stopped afterwards — only *absence* is in doubt. So a
hit stays `Match` regardless, and only a miss becomes `Unknown` when the listing
did not finish. Caps raised to depth 16 / 200,000 entries, with the entry count
as the real bound.

#### 🔴 Defect B — the pre-scan was looking in the wrong directory

**This one is a hole in a hard gate, not a detection miss.**

Both the probe and `ImageDirectoryImpl` derived "the game directory" by stripping
the filename from the executable's path. Unreal puts the exe at
`<root>\<Project>\Binaries\Win64\` — measured on Lies of P, that directory holds
**seven files**, none of which could ever have been an anti-cheat SDK, because
`EasyAntiCheat/` sits at the install root three levels up.

So for exactly the layout most likely to carry EAC, **check 4 scanned a folder
that could not contain what it was looking for** and returned clean. It also cost
Lies of P its DLSS capability, which is how the defect was noticed at all.

Fixed by `ResolveInstallRoot`: walk up from the executable to a hardcoded
platform boundary (`steamapps\common\<X>`, `GOG Galaxy\Games\<X>`,
`Epic Games\<X>`) and scan from there. Hardcoded for the same reason
`IsPlatformLauncher` is — a data-driven boundary would let a rules update move
where the hard gate looks.

**When no boundary is recognised the executable's own directory is kept.** Alan
Wake 2 is installed at `D:\another\epic\AlanWake2` with no store marker in the
path; walking up blindly would reach a folder of unrelated games, and refusing a
title because a *sibling* ships anti-cheat is a false refusal with no appeal.
That residual is stated rather than hidden: a nested executable outside a
recognised store layout is still scanned from its own directory.

#### The entry point must not change the answer — and now it does not

Unreal titles conventionally ship **two** executables: a shim at the install root
and the real shipping binary nested under `<Project>\Binaries\Win64\`. Lies of P
has `LOP.exe` and `LOP-Win64-Shipping.exe`.

That matters because a user adds one of them to the watchlist, and the guard is
handed whichever process it is handed. Before this resolution existed the two
disagreed:

| Entered via | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `LOP.exe` (root shim) | engine **undetermined**, capabilities **none** | `unreal`, `steam`, `dlss + fsr` |
| `LOP-Win64-Shipping.exe` | `unreal`, `steam`, **`fsr` only** | `unreal`, `steam`, `dlss + fsr` |

Both now resolve to the same install root and produce identical results, which is
asserted in both languages rather than left as an observation.

### Still unmeasured

The runtime table above is empty on purpose. The static half is now real and has
been run on three real installs; the per-title runtime rows still need a
**hooked** session.

**That is no longer item 2.** Item 2 closed on 2026-08-03 — the Overlay loads
into a real title and the process survives it (§7).

## 9 · Frame generation

- **Rung 1 (API / `fgEvaluations`) vs Tier-2 ETW `FrameType`: NOT RUN, and rung 1 does not
  produce a number to compare.** Measured 2026-08-15 on Cyberpunk 2077 (SL 2.7.1):
  `slEvaluateFeature(kFeatureDLSS_G)` is **never called** — 0 across ~14,000 Streamline
  batches at four frame-generation settings — so `fgEvaluations` is 0 on every record and
  there is nothing for ETW to be compared against. The comparison `15_ROADMAP` item 7 asks
  for is blocked on a PRODUCER, not on tooling.
- **What DID move with the setting is `presents / batch`, and it is a PROXY.** Five 40 s
  captures, one title, one GPU, D3D12, Ray Reconstruction on: **off → 1.000, ×2 → 2.000,
  ×4 → 4.000** (×4 three times independently, one identified swapchain and 0 gaps/0 dropped
  in every run). Application frame rate falls 85.3 → 70.9 → 63.1 as the multiplier rises,
  which is the direction frame-generation overhead predicts, and 70.9 × 2.06 = 146
  reproduces the ×2 displayed figure. So the extra presents are real, they are visible to
  our present hook, and their count tracks the configured multiplier.
  **A batch is "a present that drained a Streamline evaluation", NOT "an application
  frame"** — the two coincide here only because Ray Reconstruction happens to be evaluated
  once per application frame on this title, and no independent oracle has confirmed that.
- **THE APPLICATION-FRAME PREMISE IS STILL NOT MEASURED — a draft of this bullet said it was,
  and was corrected before it landed, 2026-08-16.** Steam's overlay read `DLSS 162 | FPS 81`
  during a ×2 capture whose own figures imply 161.7 and 80.8. That is **one** agreement, not
  two: `presents/batch` was 2.0000 exactly and 162/81 is 2.0000 exactly, so both residuals are
  forced to −0.182%. The surviving comparison is circular (the span was derived from
  `Displayed FPS`, so `presents/span` restates it), and the rival reading — that the overlay's
  `FPS` field is *displayed ÷ 2* rather than an application-frame count — predicts the identical
  number at ×2. Steam's overlay is also **not** an independent instrument: `17_HOOK_ENGINE`
  §Coexistence records that it hooks D3D presentation in-process too.
  **The discriminating run is ×4** (application frames ⇒ ≈65, fixed halving ⇒ ≈130) plus an
  FG-off leg where a genuine counter converges with displayed and a halving does not, comparing
  RATIOS — our `presents/batch` against the overlay's `DLSS/FPS` — so neither side needs a span.
  §S30 carries the full correction.

  > **GENERALISED FROM ONE TITLE TO FOUR — 2026-08-20, §8.** The bullet above rests on
  > Cyberpunk. Four titles, five captures: **`kFeatureDLSS_G` is zero on every one**, and two of
  > the four never call `slEvaluateFeature` *at all* — Black Myth: Wukong with both

  >
  > **`presents / RT-active presents` is a second proxy and covers the gap.** Wukong has no

  **`fl-baseline-probe` was run on 2026-08-16 and is RETIRED as an FG-engagement oracle by
  its own pre-committed falsifier**: against the running title with FG on at ×2 it reports
  all seven capabilities `loaded`, including `dlss_g` **and** `xefg` — two mutually exclusive
  frame-generation implementations — so `loaded` means "mapped", not "engaged", and one run
  settled it without needing the FG-off leg. Its real job, the static/loaded baseline for
  item 4, is unaffected. **The game's own frame counter is the only remaining candidate**
  and is still unrun.
- Can PresentMon 2.x `FrameType` see driver-level FG / AFMF (§M1):
- AFMF on this machine: **untested — RTX 5080, AMD driver-side feature**

### ✅ Presented FPS + the runtime census, on six real titles — 2026-09-03

The two qualifiers `03_METRICS` §Rung 0's qualifier specifies were both seen on real games,
and the report line that prints the census by name (`runtime census:`) is what made each row
below readable. Operator: the owner. Instrument: `FrameLedger.CaptureHost capture --seconds 60`,
one launch per capture, consent granted after launch. Exit codes and full reports in
`E:\frameledger-runs\2026-09-03\` (not in the repository).

| Title | API | Hooks installed | Census: FG group | Census: upscaler group | Presented FPS | Qualifier printed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **DARK SOULS III** (2016, no anti-cheat on this install) | D3D11 | Present | — | — | 59.8 | *cannot include* — the clean (a) shape |
| **KOISHIKARUBEKI** (Unity, 2D VN, x64) | D3D11 | Present | — | — | 59.6 | *cannot include* — the clean (a) shape |
| **Cyberpunk 2077** | D3D12 | Present, SL identity+params, FG evals, RT ×2 | `nvngx_dlssg`, `libxess_fg`, `ffx_frameinterpolation_x64`, `ffx_fsr3_x64`, `amd_fidelityfx_dx12` | `sl.interposer`, `nvngx`, `nvngx_dlss`, `nvngx_dlssd`, `libxess`, `ffx_fsr3upscaler` | 142.0 | **WARNING**, names listed; `presents/batch = 2` against the title's own ×2 |
| **Lies of P** ×3 — **FSR + AMD frame generation, FSR + AMD frame generation, DLSS** (operator-confirmed; no off run) | D3D12 | Present, RT ×2 — **no Streamline** | `amd_fidelityfx_dx12` in **every** run, the DLSS one included | `nvngx`, `nvngx_dlss` in every run | **231.1 / 237.5** (FG on) / **59.9** (DLSS, no FG) | **WARNING** naming `amd_fidelityfx_dx12.dll` — the facade regroup of the same morning is what put it there |
| **Hell Is Us** ×3 (off / FSR / DLSS + FG ×4 — the third labelled by the operator's own note) | D3D12 | Present, SL identity+params, FG evals, RT ×2 | `nvngx_dlssg`, `libxess_fg`, `amd_fidelityfx_framegeneration_dx12` in **every** run | `sl.interposer`, `nvngx`, `nvngx_dlss`, `nvngx_dlssd`, `libxess`, `amd_fidelityfx_upscaler_dx12` in every run | 60.0 / 60.0 / **300.4** | **WARNING**, names listed, all three runs |
| **Flower in Us** (NW.js / RPG Maker, not Ren'Py) | — | — | — | — | — | **`TargetAmbiguous`, exit 6** — no capture |

**What it settles.**

- **Both shapes are reachable on real titles**, and the census names are the loader's, not
  the directory's: Hell Is Us ships `sl.dlss_g.dll` on disk and the loader reported
  `nvngx_dlssg.dll`; Cyberpunk's row is five FG runtimes for one title.
- **The census is a STARTUP property on UE5, and it cannot see settings.** Hell Is Us
  reported the identical word `0x2794D` at off, FSR and DLSS + FG ×4; Lies of P the identical
  `0x41801` across its three. The plugins load at init whatever the menu says. So (b) *"module
  loaded, upscaling off"* and (c) *"module loaded, driven through an unhooked path"* print the
  same WARNING — exactly what `03_METRICS` says the census may and may not do, now measured.
- **The facade regroup was load-bearing.** Lies of P ships `amd_fidelityfx_dx12.dll` alone
  and the operator reports Steam's counter counting generated frames on its FSR run. With the
  facade in the upscaler group the report would have printed *"cannot include in-process
  generated frames"* on a title generating them.
- **A THIRD title where nothing goes through `slEvaluateFeature`.** Hell Is Us with DLSS on
  and frame generation at ×4: `records carrying Upscaler = 17,920 / 18,033`, **0 batches
  drained, `kFeatureDLSS = 0`**, `upscaler: N/A`. UE5's DLSS plugin drives super-resolution
  through NGX directly and its Streamline plugin drives DLSS-G somewhere this hook does not
  see. `spike-notes` §8's "two of the four" is now **three of five**. Presented 300 FPS at ×4
  reads as ~75 native, and the WARNING is the only honest line the report has for it.
- **The (a) shape is exact on a title with no vendor module at all**: DS3 and the Unity VN
  publish `runtimeCensus == 0x1`, precisely the `FL_CENSUS_RAN` equality `fl_guard` asserts on
  the harness.

**What it opens.**

- **Multi-process titles refused as `TargetAmbiguous`** — NW.js / Electron / Chromium-based
  games (RPG Maker MV/MZ, many VNs) run several `Game.exe` processes with one image path —
  browser, renderer, GPU — and the presenting one is the GPU process, which has no window of
  its own. **Resolved the same day by Chromium's `--type=gpu-process` flag** read through a
  kernel query (`20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §Scope). What the next *Flower in Us* run measures is
  whether the Overlay loads inside Chromium's GPU process at all: NW.js runs without the
  Chromium sandbox by default, so the expectation is yes, and the expectation is not a result.
- **Hell Is Us at FSR reported 60 FPS presented with the operator's Steam counter not
  counting**, identical to its off run. Whether FSR frame generation was engaged at all in
  that run is unknown; the census cannot say and the report does not claim to.
- **Second run, same evening, after #103 / #104 merged — the frame-token producer landed on
  §S31 row P4 and the NW.js shape had no GPU process.** Cyberpunk 2077 off / ×2 / ×4 (legs
  identified by their own `presents/batch` = 1.00 / 2.00 / 3.99): `presents/tokens` read
  **0.22 / 0.64 / 1.31** and `tokens/batch` **4.63 / 3.10 / 3.05**; Hell Is Us DLSS + FG ×4
  read **1.29** (17,788 presents, 13,783 tokens). The title asks for a token three to four-and-
  a-half times per application frame and gets a distinct object each time, so a count keyed on
  pointer change read the request rate. No factor was published on any leg — the ≥ 1.5 gate is
  what the table was written for. The detour now keys on the frame index; the run is owed
  again. *Flower in Us* through the merged resolver: still `TargetAmbiguous`, and the tree
  says why — browser, `crashpad-handler`, `utility` ×3, `renderer`, **no `--type=gpu-process`**;
  NW.js keeps the GPU in the browser process. Rule added for the untyped-browser shape.
- **Run 3, 2026-09-04 morning, on #105's monotone count — row P1, and §S31's question
  answered.** Cyberpunk 2077 off (RR on) / off (RR off) / ×3 / ×4: `presents/tokens` **1.00 /
  1.00 / 2.99 / 3.99**, `tokens/batch` **1.00** on every leg with batches; Hell Is Us DLSS +
  FG ×4: **4.00** (17,942 presents, 4,485 tokens, zero batches). The report printed the trio on
  the three FG legs — `61.37 → 183.49 (×2.99)`, `58.74 → 234.09 (×3.99)`, `76.54 → 306.17
  (×4)` — and refused the two off legs at 1.00 exactly as the pre-P1 gate was written to; that
  refusal is lifted in the PR that records this. **Two independent per-frame counts agreeing
  to the frame is the oracle four instruments could not be.** *Flower in Us* through #105's
  browser rule: **resolved, injected, captured** — `target: 6 processes share the image
  (browser=1, crashpad-handler=1, renderer=1, utility=3); pid 32652 is the untyped browser
  process`; 3,587 records over **three swapchains** (Chromium presents its UI and content
  separately; the dominant stream carried 3,435), `Presented FPS 59.76`, census `0x1`, the
  clean (a) shape. So the Overlay loads inside NW.js's browser process, which was the one
  thing the rule could not promise. Lies of P, FSR + FG: WARNING as before, no tokens (no
  Streamline), 239 presented.
- **Lies of P's FSR3 frame-generation presents REACH the hook** — the §H5 fear does not occur
  for the FidelityFX 3.1 facade either. The two FSR + FG runs presented 231 and 237 FPS with
  Steam's counter counting generated frames; the DLSS run, with AMD frame generation off,
  presented 59.9. So the facade's proxy swapchain forwards to the real `Present` on the shared
  `dxgi.dll` vtable, exactly as `--probe-proxy` predicted for a forwarding proxy — and the
  presented figure on those runs is therefore the DISPLAYED rate, which is what the WARNING
  says to read it as. What the run does not give is the native rate: nothing in this writer
  counts FSR3 interpolations (H11), so `fg_factor` stays N/A there. The 59.9 on the DLSS run
  is a cap or vsync, not a measurement of anything this run was about.

- **2026-09-04, the AMD identity PR (HANDOFF 7c), measured before the code was written.** Both
  Steam libraries scanned to full depth for the AMD module topology, because the hook's scoping
  depends on which module the *game* calls:

  | Title | AMD modules shipped | Shape |
  |---|---|---|
  | Lies of P, Cyberpunk 2077, Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma | `amd_fidelityfx_dx12.dll` 1.0.1.41314 | SDK 1.1.x **monolith** — a leaf |
  | Black Myth: Wukong | the monolith **and** `amd_fidelityfx_loader_dx12.dll` 2.1.0 **and** `amd_fidelityfx_denoiser_dx12.dll` | mixed |
  | Dying Light: The Beast, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II | `amd_fidelityfx_loader_dx12.dll` 1.0.2 + `amd_fidelityfx_upscaler_dx12.dll` 4.0.2 (+ `…framegeneration_dx12.dll` 3.1.5 on DL:TB) | SDK 2.x **loader + leaves** |
  | Expedition 33 | upscaler 4.0.2 + frame generation 3.1.5, **no loader** | UE5: the plugin's built-in loader calls the leaves directly |
  | Hell Is Us | upscaler **4.0.3** + frame generation **4.0.0** under `Plugins/FSR/Source/fidelityfx-sdk/Kits/FidelityFX/signedbin/`, **no loader** | UE5, SDK 2.1.x |
  | Red Dead Redemption 2 | `ffx_fsr2_api_x64.dll` + `_dx12_` + `_vk_` | FSR 2, dynamic |
  | Cyberpunk 2077 (also) | `ffx_fsr3_x64.dll`, `ffx_backend_dx12_x64.dll`, `ffx_frameinterpolation_x64.dll`, `ffx_fsr3upscaler_x64.dll`, `ffx_opticalflow_x64.dll` | FSR 3.0 host DLLs, named exports — ~~the deferred route~~ hooked 2026-09-05 at the host facade (`ffxFsr3ContextDispatchUpscale`, tag `fsr3-v3.0.4`: the module's twelve exports match that tag, not `v1.1.4`) |

  Every module in the ffx-api family exports the same five names and nothing else
  (`vendor-exports.json`) — which the morning read as "the loader can only reach a leaf through
  the leaf's own export, so the rows are the leaves and never the loader". **The evening's run
  reversed that** (below): on the three loader-shipping titles the leaves' exports stayed silent
  while FSR ran, so the loader is the game's entry and is now a row. ~~**No statically linked FSR
  title is installed**~~ — shipping is not loading: Rune Factory ships the monolith and never
  loads it.

- **2026-09-04 evening, thirteen captures across nine titles under the leaf-only build (#110), one
  launch each** — the full table with the settings the owner set is in `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §H11.
  In one line each: **Lies of P** `Fsr3` / `FsrFg` / `118.98 → 238.02 (×2)` / counts agree 1.00,
  and `none` by count with FG off; **Hell Is Us** `FSR (3.1 or 4 …)` / `FsrFg` / ×2 / 1.00, and
  `none` with FG off; **Expedition 33** FSR upscale under DLSS FG ×3 → `×2.97`, *technology not
  identified*, count from UPSCALE dispatches (no PREPARE, no token); **Cyberpunk** at FSR 3: the FSR
  3.0 host DLLs upscale (`upscaler: N/A` on that build; the host row landed 2026-09-05, §H11 B1 owed) while the 1.1.x monolith generates
  (`FsrFg`, 4261 batches, ×2); **Dying Light: The Beast** (FSR + FSR FG), **KCD2** (FSR) and
  **Wukong** (FSR): **zero dispatches at any leaf export**, `upscaler: N/A` — the loader-row
  reversal; **Rune Factory** (FSR FG): no AMD module in the census, `59.99 → 119.95 (×2)` from
  Streamline tokens, *technology not identified* — 7b's statically linked title, with the count
  surviving and the identity not. **Row R6, same night, on #111:** DL:TB FSR + FSR FG →
  `FSR (3.1 or 4 …)` / `FsrFg` / `70.49 → 140.9 (×2)` / 1.01 and KCD2 FSR → identity + `none` /
  1.00, both through the loader row at 1×; Wukong FSR (×2 runs) → silent at monolith and loader
  with the monolith loaded, and the title has no FSR frame-generation option — FSR upscaling
  compiled in (Rune Factory's shape), the monolith shipped and loaded for nothing this hook sees.
- **2026-09-04, late: Dying Light: The Beast at DLSS, three captures (23:31 / 23:39 / 23:43), for
  7a after Alan Wake 2 would not run.** The first Streamline title measured whose batches carry
  `kFeatureDLSS`: `upscaler: Dlss` on 4720/4783, 4271/4345 and 4575/4657 records, `FPS 80.41 /
  72.73 / 77.69`, every batch identified, RT measured on ~98% of presents. **`UpscalerParams`
  0 of N on all three**, `render -> output: N/A`, quality byte never published. Cause, measured
  with dumpbin: DL:TB ships `sl.interposer.dll` **2.8.0**, which exports `slSetTagForFrame`
  (Cyberpunk's 2.7.1 does not); `sl.h` marks `slSetTag` deprecated in its favour, and a 2.8 title
  tagging per frame never calls the export the only params row hooked. The oracle had hidden it:
  `vendor-exports.ps1` recorded the FIRST `sl.interposer.dll` found (2.7.4.0), so the 2.8 export
  was absent from `docs/vendor-exports.json` until the tool unioned across copies (ten copies,
  eight distinct versions from 1.5.6 to 2.10.3). All three runs read `frame generation: none`
  with presents = tokens = batches; **which of the three had DLSS Frame Generation on is the
  owner's to say** — if any did, `none` there is the §H5 false negative on a title where the FG
  runtime (`sl.dlss_g.dll`) is in the census, and it is a finding about DLSS-G on SL 2.8, not
  about the tag row. Row added; rerun owed.
- **2026-09-05 00:19, DL:TB at DLSS again, on the #115 build** (the payload is the CaptureHost
  bin's `FrameLedger.Overlay.dll`, rebuilt 00:17): `Dlss` 4331/4401, `FPS 73.64`, and
  **`UpscalerParams` still 0 of 4401** with the params family live — which, under
  publish-when-whole, means BOTH tag rows were patched. So the title either tags the scaling
  input with a **zero extent** ("use the entire resource") or tags it nowhere we hook. The
  zero-extent reading is the one the record can still act on: `sl::Resource` carries its own
  `width/height` (mandatory only on Vulkan, so filled or not on D3D12 at the title's choice),
  and `TagSize` in `fl_sl_inputs.h` now reads them when the extent is zero — on every route,
  local and both global — GUID-checked, from the argument the hooked API received. If the
  next run prints a `render -> output` line, that was the shape; if not, the title does not
  state the size on this route at all and the honest line stays `N/A`.
- **2026-09-05 00:53, DL:TB at DLSS on the #116 build (payload rebuilt 00:51): `N/A` stands.**
  `Dlss` 3460/3523, `FPS 58.87`, **`UpscalerParams` 0 of 3523**, both tag rows live, the
  whole-resource fallback in. So on this title the scaling-input tag reaches neither global
  export with a size in either place, or does not reach them at all — the record cannot
  separate those two, and that is the one thing left to instrument if 7a is ever reopened on
  this title (a tag-route census: calls seen per export, zero-extent seen, Resource-size seen —
  a record bit or a writer-state word, so a layout bump). **7a on DL:TB closes as measured
  `N/A`** for the quality byte and the render size; the derived label has no input here and
  stays the owner's decision for the titles that do print the line (Cyberpunk).
  `frame generation: none` again with presents = tokens = 3441 and DLSS FG on — the fifth
  such run, §H5.
- **And the owner's answer to the FG question: all four DLSS runs had DLSS Frame Generation
  ON.** `presents = tokens` on every one, against ×2 with FSR FG on the same title and ×3.99
  on Cyberpunk (SL 2.7.1, DLSS-G 310.8) — recorded in `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §H5 as case 3's
  candidate, with the discriminator (the owner's counter reading) pre-committed there.
- **2026-09-05, the owner's run on #118 + #119 — eleven captures, seven titles, every one with
  DLSS or frame generation on**, the first with the `module:` lines (interposer versions read off
  the files: DL:TB 2.8.0, Cyberpunk 2.7.1, Hell Is Us 2.7.3, Expedition 33 2.7.30, Wukong 2.7.4;
  `_nvngx.dll` 32.0.16.1664 from the driver store on every NVIDIA title):

  | Title / setting | What printed | Reading |
  |---|---|---|
  | **Cyberpunk 2077**, FSR 3 + FSR FG | `upscaler: Fsr3` (host route, 4332 records at 1506×847), `FsrFg`, `74.31 → 148.56 (×2)`, `frames/upscale-drained 1.01` | **§H11 B1 accepted** |
  | **Cyberpunk 2077**, FSR 3, FG off | `Fsr3`, `none` by count 4919/4919, `1506x847 -> 2560x1440 = 1.7x (59%)` | **B1-off accepted** |
  | **Cyberpunk 2077**, DLSS + RR + MFG ×3 | `Dlss` (via RR, 3704 batches), `62.86 → 187.49 (×2.98)`, `Active (technology not identified)`, `render 1707x960` on 3677 records | count right, DLSS-G unnamed (`kFeatureDLSS_G` never evaluated) |
  | **Dying Light: The Beast**, DLSS FG ×4 (twice) | `Presented FPS 76.7` / `93.24`, **`none` WITHHELD** with the §H5 qualifier, `sl.interposer.dll 2.8.0.0` named | **owner's counter ~300 = 3.9× ours** — reading (a) with its number |
  | **Hell Is Us**, DLSS + FG ×4 (twice) | `82.23 → 328.98 (×4)`, `Active (technology not identified)`, `upscaler: N/A`; the first run refused the factor (bucket 2.25 vs 3.65 — 53 unfocused ticks) | NGX-direct SR, Streamline tokens still count |
  | **Expedition 33**, DLSS + FG (twice) | `54.9 → 218.38 (×3.98)`, `Active (technology not identified)`, `upscaler: N/A` | same shape |
  | **Black Myth: Wukong**, DLSS + FG ×4 | `55.39 → 221.53 (×4)`, `Active (technology not identified)`, `upscaler: N/A`, `sl.dlss_g.dll 2.7.4.0` loaded | same shape; the plugin bit is set on a 2.7 title, and the gate correctly did not fire (factor active) |
  | **Lies of P**, DLSS, no FG (owner) | `Presented FPS 59.77`, WARNING naming `amd_fidelityfx_dx12.dll`, `upscaler: N/A`, `tokens=0` | NGX-direct SR with no Streamline at all: nothing this build hooks fires |

  Two things the run found beyond the rows. **A consumer defect:** `render -> output: N/A` on every
  FG-on capture — Cyberpunk at FSR 3 + FG printed it two lines under `render 1506x847 on 4332
  record(s)` — because `UpscaleExtent` keyed its window on the params bit, which under frame
  generation rides on one present in N; fixed the same day (identity-bit window). **And the shape
  of what is left:** on every NVIDIA title measured the *count* is right and the *identity* is
  what this build cannot say — DLSS on four NGX-direct titles, DLSS-G on all of them — because
  the NGX SDK is licence-blocked and `kFeatureDLSS_G` is never evaluated through the export the
  Streamline hook owns. `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §H5 carries the one candidate that is not a hook
  (`NvAPI_NGX_GetNGXOverrideState`, by PID) and the probe that measures it before anything is
  built on it.

- **2026-09-05 evening, the owner's run on #121 (the tag route) — eight captures, six titles, every one at DLSS**
  **with frame generation on**, the first with the `Streamline tag census:` line. The pre-commitment in
  `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §H5 landed on every title that goes through Streamline:

  | Title / setting | `frame generation:` | Trio | Tag census (route: types) |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | **Hell Is Us**, DLSS + FG ×4 (twice) | **`DlssG`** | `38.5 → 154.04 (×4)`, `81.41 → 325.58 (×4)` | global: depth, mvec, hudless, ui-color-alpha, backbuffer, other |
  | **Expedition 33**, DLSS + FG ×2 | **`DlssG`** | `75.95 → 149.83 (×1.97)` | global: same set |
  | **Black Myth: Wukong**, DLSS + FG ×4 | **`DlssG`** | `47.99 → 191.89 (×4)` | global: depth, mvec, hudless, ui-color-alpha, backbuffer |
  | **Rune Factory**, DLSS + FG ×4 | **`DlssG`** | `128.85 → 513.02 (×3.98)` | global: same as Hell Is Us |
  | **Cyberpunk 2077**, DLSS + RR + MFG | **`DlssG`**, `upscaler: Dlss`, `1707x960 -> 2560x1440 = 1.5x (67%)` | **factor refused** — bucket 1 of 8 reads 3.0 against 1.67 overall; `tokens/batch 2.97` | global: depth, mvec, hudless, scaling-in, scaling-out, other (no UI tag) |
  | **Dying Light: The Beast**, DLSS FG ×4 | N/A (`none` withheld, §H5) + *"it is FEEDING frame generation"* | `Presented FPS 67.13` | **frame** (`slSetTagForFrame`): depth, mvec, hudless, scaling-in, scaling-out, ui-color-alpha, other |

  Three readings. **The identity is measured on six of six Streamline titles** — the UE Streamline plugin tags
  the DLSS-G inputs globally (`slSetTag`) on every UE title, Cyberpunk on 2.7.1 tags globally too, DL:TB on 2.8
  tags through `slSetTagForFrame` — so `Active (technology not identified)` is gone from every one of them,
  and `upscaler: N/A` on the UE titles is now the ONLY NVIDIA gap (NGX-direct super-resolution, the NVAPI
  probe's job). **DL:TB's 7a question is answered by the census, at no layout cost**: the title DOES tag
  `kBufferTypeScalingInputColor`, through the 2.8 export, and `UpscalerParams` is still 0 of 4030 — so the tag
  carries neither an extent nor a Resource size, which is exactly the shape #116 named and could not see; the
  `N/A` there is the title's truth. **Cyberpunk's refusal is the guard working**: `tokens/batch 2.97` with
  `presents/batch 4.97` and bucket 1 at 3.0 is a session whose state changed after the first eighth — tokens
  kept flowing while Ray Reconstruction stopped being evaluated, which is what a menu or a pause does — and the
  report refused the session-level number rather than averaging two configurations (the 2026-08-16 alt-tab
  lesson). The owner's settings for that run are recorded when known; the earlier 14:01 run at MFG ×3 read
  `×2.98` with `tokens/batch 1.00` on the same title.

- **2026-09-05 night, the owner's run on #124 (the DXGI present counter) — DL:TB twice, Hell Is Us, and a
  new title, the Onimusha: Way of the Sword demo on Streamline 2.10.3.** `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §H5 row
  P1-DXGI landed on the first title and both controls read zero:

  | Title / Streamline | Trio or Presented | `DXGI present counter:` | `frame generation:` |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | **Dying Light: The Beast**, 2.8.0, DLSS FG ×4 (21:56) | `Presented FPS 69.99` (withheld) | `unseen=12204 over samples=4136 (2.95)` | N/A (withheld) + *FEEDING* |
  | **Dying Light: The Beast**, 2.8.0, DLSS FG ×4 (22:06) | `Presented FPS 73.19` (withheld) | `unseen=12741 over samples=4392 (2.90)` | same |
  | **Hell Is Us**, 2.7.3, DLSS + FG ×4 | `79.89 → 308.14 (×3.86)` | `unseen=0 over samples=18207` | `DlssG` |
  | **Onimusha: Way of the Sword demo**, **2.10.3**, DLSS + FG | `60.04 → 220.33 (×3.67)` | `unseen=0 over samples=12914` | `DlssG`, `upscaler: Dlss`, RT Yes (27.1 %) |

  The 2.8.0 pacer presents on the hooked chain through a body the inline patches do not cover; 2.7.3 and
  2.10.3 present through the body they do. The owner's "`sl.interposer.dll` + `sl.common.dll` must be
  loaded on ≥ 2.8" lead is closed by the 2.10.3 title: it injects, tags on the frame route (`depth, mvec,
  hudless, scaling-in, scaling-out, ui-color-alpha, backbuffer, other`) and counts like 2.7. Onimusha's
  `render -> output: N/A` with `UpscalerParams 0/13014` is DL:TB's shape again — the frame-route tags carry
  no size on D3D12, where `sl::Resource` declares none. The PR after #124 turns the 2.8.0 reading into a
  DXGI-COUNTED Displayed (`03_METRICS` §Displayed may be DXGI-COUNTED).

- **2026-09-06 morning, the owner's run on #125 — DL:TB three times (frame generation on, then off twice)
  and Expedition 33 with frame generation off.** The promotion landed and §H5's Leg 0 answered:

  | Title / setting | Line | `DXGI present counter:` | `frame generation:` |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | **Dying Light: The Beast**, DLSS FG ×4 (07:31) | `Native FPS: 70.52 -> Displayed FPS: 282.08 (x4 FG) over 16516 present(s)` + *Displayed is DXGI-COUNTED: 12387* | `unseen=12483 over samples=4202 (2.97)` | **`DlssG`** |
  | **Dying Light: The Beast**, DLSS, FG **off** (07:45) | `Presented FPS 75.52` (withheld) | `unseen=0 over samples=4519` | N/A (withheld) — census still `0x25F0F`, tags `0x23600` (no hudless / UI) |
  | **Dying Light: The Beast**, DLSS, FG **off** (07:55) | `Presented FPS 61.14` (withheld) | `unseen=0 over samples=3659` | same |
  | **Expedition 33**, FG off (Streamline 2.7.30) | `FPS: 85.86` | `unseen=0 over samples=5063` | `none` by count; tag census `0x0` |

  Two readings. **The trio is printed on the title that could not print it**, from a count DXGI made
  (12,387 presents this hook never timed), and it is the number the owner's own counter showed (~300 at
  ×4 against ~75 native). **Leg 0: `sl.dlss_g.dll` is a startup-time load** — the census cannot tell FG
  off from FG on, exactly the cost the gate pre-committed — but the DXGI counter can (0 unseen with FG
  off, 2.9–3.0 with it on), so the gate is narrowed to sessions where the counter was not read, and the
  two FG-off captures above print `none` with DXGI's agreement on the next build. Also visible: with FG
  off DL:TB sends no hudless / UI tag and the UE plugin sends no tags at all, so the DLSS-G identity is
  per-setting on both.

- **2026-09-06, 09:20–09:35, the NVAPI probe against three running titles (`fl-probe-nvapi --ngx-state
  <pid>`, driver 616.64), each beside a capture on the #126 build.** The question §H5 opened on 2026-09-05 —
  are the driver's per-process NGX feedback bits populated without an NVIDIA-app override? — is answered
  YES for super resolution and NO for frame generation:

  | Title / override / capture beside it | SR | RR | FG | `scalingRatio` / `performanceMode` / `renderPreset` / `frameGenerationCount` |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | **Hell Is Us**, no override, `83.21 → 332.82 (×4 FG)` `DlssG`, `upscaler: N/A` | `0x80605` CREATED EVALUATE (+ INITIALIZED DLL_EXISTS ERR_NOT_FOUND) | INITIALIZED DLL_EXISTS ERR_NOT_FOUND | `0x5` INITIALIZED DLL_EXISTS only | 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 |
  | **Expedition 33**, override ON, FG off, `FPS: 79.4` `none` (DXGI agrees), `upscaler: N/A` | `0x8067F` CREATED EVALUATE ENABLED DLL_LOADED DLL_SELECTED PRESET PERF_MODE (+ …) | INITIALIZED DLL_EXISTS ERR_NOT_FOUND | `0x1F` INITIALIZED ENABLED DLL_EXISTS DLL_LOADED DLL_SELECTED | 0 / 2 / 11 / 0 |
  | **Lies of P**, no override, `Presented FPS 59.89`, `upscaler: N/A` | `0x605` CREATED EVALUATE (+ INITIALIZED DLL_EXISTS) | INITIALIZED ERR_FAILED ERR_NOT_FOUND | INITIALIZED ERR_FAILED ERR_NOT_FOUND | 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 |

  The SR word carries the identity the hooks cannot see on these three titles; the FG word does not see
  DLSS-G running at ×4 (it tracks the override machinery's DLL, not the plugin), `frameGenerationCount` is
  the override target and not the multiplier, and `scalingRatio` is 0 even under the override. §H5 carries
  what a driver-reported rung may and may not claim, and the negative still owed (DLSS off in the menu).
  Also on this run: Expedition 33 with FG off now prints `none` with *DXGI's own present counter agrees:
  0 unseen over 4774* (#126), and Lies of P's `Presented FPS` keeps its "MAY include generated frames"
  qualifier because `amd_fidelityfx_dx12.dll` is loaded there — the census cannot say `none` and the
  token count is 0 on that title, so that line is right as printed.

- **2026-09-06, 10:39–11:36, the owner's run on #128 (the driver-reported rung) — §H5 rows N1–N4 and one
  correction.** The standalone probe first: Lies of P with upscaling OFF reads `SR 0x5` (CREATED clear), with
  DLSS on `0x605` — N3 keeps the rung. Then the captures:

  | Title / setting | `upscaler:` | `NVIDIA driver NGX state:` SR / RR / FG | FG line |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | **Lies of P**, DLSS (no override) | **`Dlss (driver-reported: …)`** | `0x605` / `0x90001` / `0x90001` | N/A (no FG in this title) |
  | **Expedition 33**, override ON, FG off | **`Dlss (driver-reported: …)`** | `0x8067F` (mode 2, preset 11) / `0x80005` / `0x1F` | `none`, DXGI agrees |
  | **Hell Is Us**, DLSS + FG ×4 | **`Dlss (driver-reported: …)`** | `0x80605` / `0x80005` / **`0x605`** (CHANGED between readings) | `81.32 → 321.73 (×3.96)`, `DlssG` |
  | **Onimusha demo**, SL 2.10.3, DLSS + FG | `Dlss — the NVIDIA driver agrees` | `0x605` / `0x5` / **`0x605`** (CHANGED) | `59.99 → 235.47 (×3.93)`, `DlssG` |
  | **Dying Light: The Beast**, DLSS + FG ×4 | `Dlss — the NVIDIA driver agrees` | `0x605` / `0x90001` / **`0x605`** (CHANGED) | `39.63 → 158.5 (×4)` DXGI-COUNTED, `DlssG` |
  | **Cronos: The New Dawn demo** (new; UE, **SL 2.8.0**), DLSS, FG off | **`Dlss (driver-reported: …)`** | `0x80605` / `0x80005` / `0x5` | `FPS 105.01`, `none`, DXGI agrees; RT Yes |
  | **Dying Light: The Beast**, **FSR upscaling + DLSS FG** | `FSR (3.1 or 4 …)`, `2560x1440 -> 2560x1440` | **`0x205`** (CREATED, not EVALUATE) / `0x90001` / `0x605` | `DlssG` from the tags; factor REFUSED (bucket 8 of 8 at 1.96 vs 2.85); DXGI 1.80 unseen / present |

  Three readings. **The rung works as written and its negative held.** **The FG word is not blind** — the
  morning's Hell Is Us reading was taken before the feature came up, and every ×4 session's loop readings
  show `CREATED | EVALUATE` with the word changing mid-session; the multiplier bits never set, so it is an
  identity witness and is now printed beside `frame generation:`. **`SR 0x205` on the FSR session is the
  word telling the truth finely**: DLSS was created at some point (the title initialises it) and not
  evaluated, and the rung's two-bit key keeps it from claiming DLSS beside FSR. The FSR + DLSS-G session
  also exposed a wrong qualifier ("no evaluation was observed" beside 4,415 tokens and a refused factor),
  fixed the same day. Cronos is a second Streamline 2.8.0 title; its FG-on capture is the one that says
  whether the pacer bypass measured on DL:TB belongs to SDK 2.8.0 or to that title.

- **2026-09-06, 12:17, Cronos: The New Dawn demo with frame generation ON — the row that closed §H5's
  DLSS / DLSS-G question.** Streamline 2.8.0, UE: `Native FPS: 86.8 -> Displayed FPS: 172.72 (x1.99 FG)`
  over 9,948 presents, `unseen=0 over samples=10063`, tag census `frame=[depth, mvec, hudless,
  ui-color-alpha, backbuffer, other]`, `frame generation: DlssG — the NVIDIA driver agrees`, `upscaler: Dlss
  (driver-reported)`, RT Yes. The 2.8.0 SDK presents its generated frames through the body the inline
  patches cover; the bypass measured on Dying Light: The Beast is that title's integration. With this row
  every measured NVIDIA title prints the rule-6 trio or a counted `none`, and the owner closed the item.

- **2026-09-06, 12:46, Lies of P at FSR 3.1 + FSR frame generation, on the #129 build — §H11 row A1 again,
  now with every witness on the page.** `upscaler: Fsr3`, `render -> output: 2560x1440 -> 2560x1440 = 1x` on
  3,538 records, `frame generation: FsrFg`, `Native FPS: 59.77 -> Displayed FPS: 119.55 (x2 FG)` over 7,042
  presents; the ffx census `upscale-drained=3518  fg-dispatch-drained=3518  frames=3520`, `presents/frame=2.00`,
  `frames/upscale-drained=1.00`; `DXGI present counter: unseen=0 over samples=7096` (the FSR 3.1 pacer presents
  through the patched body); the NVIDIA driver's word `SR 0x5` / `FG 0x90001` — nothing created, so the
  driver-reported rung correctly says nothing beside an AMD identity. The census names only
  `amd_fidelityfx_dx12.dll` (the 3.1 monolith Lies of P calls) — the AMD half of 7c is complete on its oracle.
  Same run, Rune Factory at DLSS + FG ×4: `125.45 → 498.51 (×3.97)`, `Dlss (driver-reported)`, `DlssG` with the
  driver agreeing — the 7b title on its NVIDIA path.

- **2026-09-06, 13:45–14:02, the owner's run on #132 (rung 3 by elimination + the executable scan): Cronos at
  XeSS (no FG option), Hell Is Us at XeSS + XeSS-FG, Rune Factory at FSR + FSR FG.**

  | Title / setting | Line | `frame generation:` | `executable markers:` |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | **Cronos**, XeSS, no FG | `FPS: 110.02`, `none` by count, DXGI agrees | `None` | ffxFrameInterpolation ×1, NVSDK_NGX ×112, xefgSwapChain ×13 |
  | **Hell Is Us**, XeSS + **XeSS-FG** | `Presented FPS: 186.47`, **`tokens=0`**, `unseen=0` | N/A — no token on this plugin at XeSS; witnesses: not DLSS-G, no FSR dispatch, runtimes nvngx_dlssg + libxess_fg + amd FG, file carries xefgSwapChain | same set |
  | **Rune Factory**, FSR + **FSR FG** (compiled in) | `30.05 → 60.05 (×2 FG)` from the token, `unseen=0` | `Active (technology not identified) — by elimination …; the executable itself carries ffxFsr3, ffxFrameInterpolation` | ffxFsr3 ×13, ffxFrameInterpolation ×9, NVSDK_NGX ×112 |

  Three readings. Rune Factory is the pre-committed 7b line, verbatim. XeFG presents through the patched
  body (0 unseen) so its Displayed rate is measured; its Native is not, because Hell Is Us's plugin requests
  no Streamline token at XeSS (it does at DLSS, and Cronos's does at XeSS) — the count producer is the
  plugin's choice, and nothing in policy replaces it. The Steam overlay could not show FG on that session
  either. The upscaler N/A on both XeSS titles now names Intel's licence as the reason (7c item 4).

## 10 · Telemetry layering

- L1 baseline vendor-neutral:
- `D3DKMT` perf-data probe on Win 10 22H2 **and** Win 11 — stable enough to keep:
- L2: LHM fields returned per vendor (fill `18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS` §Capability
  matrix; use explicit "untested", never `?`, for absent hardware): **NVIDIA measured
  2026-09-03**, below. AMD and Intel stay `untested` (§R5/§R6).
- L2: **GPU sensors unelevated, without PawnIO** (§M5) — decides whether the
  default unelevated Agent has temperatures at all: **YES — row R1 of the table
  pre-committed in `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §M5, measured 2026-09-03, unelevated and
  elevated giving the identical field set.**

  Instrument: `FrameLedger.CaptureHost probe-lhm --seconds 3` (`LhmComputerAdapter`
  with `IsGpuEnabled` only, then the same tree read through `LhmTelemetrySource`).
  Machine: RTX 5080, **driver 616.56** (`nvidia-smi`; §Environment's 32.0.16.1088 /
  610.88 is what it was on 2026-08-02 and 2026-08-05), Windows 10.0.29648, LHM
  **0.9.6.0**, PawnIO installed on the box but **never opened** — only LHM's CPU and
  board groups use it, and the GPU group was the only one enabled.

  Unelevated (`process elevated: False`), every tick of three:

  | LHM sensor | Type | Value | → `GpuSample` |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `GPU Core` | Temperature | 40.4 °C | `TempCoreC` |
  | `GPU Memory Junction` | Temperature | 50 °C | `TempMemoryC` |
  | `GPU Core` | Load | 0–5 % (idle) | `LoadPct` |
  | `GPU Memory Used` | SmallData | 3,071–3,089 MB | `VramAdapterMb` |
  | `GPU Core` / `GPU Memory` | Clock | 2,655–2,677 / 14,801 MHz | `CoreClockMhz` / `MemClockMhz` |
  | `GPU Package` | Power | 54.4–55.7 W | `PowerW` |
  | `GPU Fan 1..3` | Fan | ~1,200 rpm | `FanRpm` (fan 1) |
  | *(no `GPU Hot Spot` sensor at all)* | — | — | `TempHotspotC` = **N/A** |

  Also present and deliberately **not** mapped: `GPU Memory` *Load* (VRAM-in-use as a
  percentage, 18.9 %), `D3D Shared Memory Used` (279 MB of system RAM — the first draft
  of the fragment rule took it as VRAM; `SensorMapTests.SharedMemoryIsNotVram` pins the
  correction), three `Control` sensors (fan duty 30 %), `GPU Bus` / `GPU Video Engine` /
  fourteen `D3D *` engine loads, `GPU Core Voltage`, `GPU PCIe Rx/Tx`.

  Through the port: `TryRead=True`, `Capabilities = TempCore, TempMemory, Load,
  VramAdapter, CoreClock, MemClock, Power, Fan`, `faults=0`. **Elevated control run**
  (`process elevated: True`, launched through UAC): the same eight fields, the same
  values to within idle drift, the same verdict. Elevation adds nothing to GPU
  sensors on this vendor.

  **What it settles:** the unelevated Agent's Tier-2 session has GPU temperature, load,
  power, clocks, VRAM use and fan speed on NVIDIA. The three user-facing sentences stand
  (row R1: they *may* name the fields). **What it does not settle:** hotspot temperature —
  absent here, and whether that is the driver, the GPU generation or LHM 0.9.6 is
  unmeasured; and anything about AMD or Intel.
- L3: Reflex latency, throttle reasons, per-domain utilisation: **not yet** — but L3
  now initialises and is proven to degrade cleanly. Measured 2026-08-05 by
  `ctest fl_nvapi_probe` after vendoring: `NvAPI_Initialize` → `NVAPI_OK`, driver
  **610.88** (branch `r610_85`), **1** physical GPU, "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080".
  The absent-driver path is exercised by CI, where the probe prints
  `BRANCH: DEGRADED` and exits 0 — `nvapi64.lib` is a static stub library reaching
  `nvapi64.dll` through `nvapi_QueryInterface` at first call, so it is **not** a
  load-time dependency and a machine with no NVIDIA driver still loads the binary.
  The fields in this bullet need `NvapiTelemetrySource`, which does not exist.
- L3 · **a doc error the vendoring found, which reading vendor documentation would
  not have**: `18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS` §L3's table named `NvAPI_GPU_GetMemoryInfo`. The
  vendored headers mark it `__nvapi_deprecated_function` ("deprecated in release
  520 — use `NvAPI_GPU_GetMemoryInfoEx`"), so under `/W4 /WX` a call to it fails the
  native build. Table corrected. This is the class `17_HOOK_ENGINE` calls the highest
  false-confidence risk in the spike, in a document rather than in code.

## 11 · PresentMon / Tier 2 *(§M2, §M6)*

### ◐ Measured 2026-08-20 — the binary is here, and it will not run for us

- **Console binary obtained, version, pinned hash: ✅**
  `C:\Program Files\Intel\PresentMon\PresentMonConsoleApplication\PresentMon-2.5.1-x64.exe`,
  **956,768 bytes**, SHA256
  `9BEC3083069F58F911E6A512F4806DB51A27BD096103087BC1D05EF54C80A191`.
  Version **2.5.1**, read from its own `--help` banner.

  > **It carries NO VERSIONINFO at all** — `FileVersion`, `ProductVersion` and
  > `CompanyName` are all empty. So "pin the version" has to mean **pin the hash
  > and the filename**; there is nothing in the file for a `versioninfo-check`-style
  > gate to read. Worth stating because this repository requires exactly that
  > metadata of everything it builds (`19_SAFETY`, `tools/versioninfo-check.ps1`),
  > and a bundled third-party binary that lacks it is a packaging fact, not a
  > detail.

- **Runs unelevated: 🔴 NO, on this machine.** Measured against
  `hook-harness --hold-presenting`, current user `DESKTOP-NUHVIDP\Anon`:

  ```
  error: failed to start trace session: access denied.
         PresentMon requires either administrative privileges or to be run by a
         user in the "Performance Log Users" user group.
  ```

  Exit code **6**, no CSV written. The account is in `BUILTIN\Users`,
  `docker-users` and `Authenticated Users` — **not** an administrator, and **not**
  in `Performance Log Users` (`S-1-5-32-559`), so the refusal is exactly what it
  says rather than something subtler.

- **Performance Log Users sufficient without admin: ❓ UNMEASURED**, and it stays
  that way here. Adding an account to a local group is a system settings change and
  it needs administrative rights of its own; it is the owner's to do, not a session's.

- **The shared service is running and it does NOT help the console.**
  `PresentMonSharedService` is `Running` / `Automatic`, `StartName = LocalSystem`,
  from `C:\Program Files\Intel\PresentMonSharedService\PresentMonService.exe`. The
  console binary still starts its **own** trace session and still fails. So §M6's
  "or the PresentMon Service" half is not answered by the service merely being
  installed — the console does not talk to it. Whether `PresentMon.exe` (the
  Application, a GUI) does is unmeasured and would not produce a CSV anyway.

- **2.x column set over stdout: ❓ UNMEASURED.** No session, no CSV, no header. This
  is the input `tools/frametype-oracle.ps1` parses, so **that parser has never seen
  a real PresentMon CSV** — it resolves columns by name and refuses loudly on
  anything it does not recognise, and its decision table is the only thing standing
  behind it. Said plainly rather than left for the next reader to assume.

### 🔴 THE RUN HAPPENED — 2026-08-27, three legs, three game launches, and row **P2**

Owner-run from an elevated shell via a three-leg runbook script. **That script is not in
this repository** — it drove PresentMon, so it was closed unmerged when PresentMon was dropped
the same day; do not go looking for it. Cyberpunk 2077, frame
generation off / ×2 / ×4 set in the title's own menu, 40 s per leg, one game launch
each. Analysis is in `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §S31; what belongs here is what was measured.

**The 2.x column set, which §M2 left unmeasured: 24 columns.**

```
Application, ProcessID, SwapChainAddress, PresentRuntime, SyncInterval, PresentFlags,
AllowsTearing, PresentMode, FrameType, CPUStartTime, FrameTime, CPUBusy, CPUWait,
GPULatency, GPUTime, GPUBusy, GPUWait, DisplayLatency, DisplayedTime, AnimationError,
AnimationTime, MsFlipDelay, AllInputToPhotonLatency, ClickToPhotonLatency
```

**`FrameType` is present, and every row of all three legs reads `Application`.**
Counted off the raw CSVs rather than off the tool's own summary:

| leg | rows | distinct `FrameType` values |
|---|---|---|
| off | 1,937 | `Application` × 1,937 |
| ×2 | 6,488 | `Application` × 6,488 |
| ×4 | 10,881 | `Application` × 10,881 |

**And the two instruments agree on the present rate to within 0.3%**, which is what
makes the finding a measurement rather than a shrug — PresentMon SAW the generated
presents:

| leg | our hook | PresentMon | our `presents/batch` | our `evaluations` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| off | 1,676 presents / 38.82 s = **43.16 /s** | 1,937 / 45 s = **43.04 /s** | N/A — no batch drained | 0 |
| ×2 | 5,746 / 38.64 s = **144.31 /s** | 6,488 / 45 s = **144.18 /s** | **2.00** | 0 |
| ×4 | 9,652 / 38.77 s = **241.84 /s** | 10,881 / 45 s = **241.80 /s** | **3.99** | 0 |

Every leg: `status=Ready`, `faults=0`, `layoutVersion=3`, `attach=Ok`, one stream, one
segment, **0 gaps and 0 dropped**, `unidentified=0`.

So displayed rate tracks the configured multiplier, both instruments count the same
present stream, and at ×4 roughly three presents in four cannot be application frames
— while PresentMon classifies **100%** of them `Application`. That is §S31 row **P2**,
and `tools/frametype-oracle.ps1` reported it as a **falsifier** on all three legs
rather than as a ratio of 1.0, which is the one behaviour it was written to guarantee.

**Unmeasured, and it decides the REASON rather than the action:** whether
`--track_frame_type` was in effect at all. If `FrameType` ships in `--v2_metrics`
output regardless of the flag, these legs recorded a default. The discriminator is one
five-second run **without** the flag, checking only whether the header carries the
column — no game, no capture, no launch spent. It still needs elevation; attempted
unelevated 2026-08-27 and refused with the same exit 6 this section opens with.

> **Both branches end at the same action**, which is why §S31 landed anyway: either the
> vendor emitted nothing, or the invocation produced no frame-type data at all. In
> neither case did PresentMon answer the question **as invoked**.

**The discriminator was run on 2026-08-27 and produced no file at all**, so it settled nothing:
the command targeted `explorer.exe`, which may present nothing PresentMon tracks, and "no CSV"
is indistinguishable from "no `FrameType` column". Badly chosen target, recorded as such. Moot
now — PresentMon was dropped the same day — and written down so nobody re-runs it thinking it
is untried.
**Two findings nobody was looking for.**

- **The `off` leg drained ZERO Streamline batches**, against `presents/batch = 1.000`
  at off in §8. The difference is Ray Reconstruction: §S30 established RR is evaluated
  once per application frame, so with RR on there are batches even with FG off. RR was
  not on here. **Our side therefore had two readable legs, not three** — turn RR on if
  the off leg needs to carry a ratio.
- **The CSV's first column is named `Application`** and holds the process name, while
  the value being counted, in column 9, is also the string `Application`. A parser
  resolving by position — or grepping for the word — counts process names and reports a
  ratio from them. `frametype-oracle.ps1`'s *"resolved BY NAME from the header, never by
  position"* was written before it had ever seen a real CSV, against exactly the
  collision that was waiting in it.

**`kFeatureDLSS_G` is zero on all three legs**, which takes the count to five capture
sets across five titles. `HANDOFF` item 3's premise has now failed everywhere it has
been looked for.

**Artifacts:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FrameLedger\s31\{off,x2,x4}\` — `presentmon.csv` and
`capturehost-report.txt` per leg. Not committed; they are measurement output and the
numbers above are the record.

### 🔴 `--track_frame_type` is a BETA option that needs the VENDOR to cooperate

This is the finding, and it lands on a pre-committed oracle. `PresentMon 2.5.1
--help`, verbatim, under **Beta Options**:

> `--track_frame_type`  Track the type of each displayed frame; **requires
> application and/or driver instrumentation using Intel-PresentMon provider.**

So `FrameType` is **not** a general ETW classification of any present. It is a
report of events the application or the graphics driver chose to emit through
Intel's provider. `03_METRICS` rung 2 says *"PresentMon 2.x `FrameType` column
reports generated frames directly"* and §S30 called it *"a mechanism that divides
by nothing"* — both are true of the mechanism and neither is a promise that the
mechanism is **available** on an NVIDIA DLSS-G title. Whether NVIDIA's driver
instruments that provider is the make-or-break question and is unmeasured.

**The falsifier is written before the run** (§S31): if a DLSS-G capture comes back
with no `FrameType` column, or with every row spelled `Application` while frame
generation was demonstrably on, PresentMon is retired as the application-frame
oracle for NVIDIA frame generation **in that same row** — exactly as
`fl-baseline-probe` was, rather than being re-run until it answers.

## 12 · The gate's own inputs — §S21 and §S20 *(2026-08-04)*

Analysis and the decisions live in `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §S21 and §S20. What
belongs here is what was **run**.

### ✅ §S21 · The override, demonstrated end to end on two real binaries

Same input to both — a crafted twelve-line rules file naming the three families
`IsCompleteEnoughToGate` required, with values that match nothing, plus a real
`EasyAntiCheat_x64.dll` loaded in the target:

| Binary | Verdict |
|---|---|
| `bb0da0a`, the tree before the fix | **`Allow`** |
| The fix branch | **`BlockedModule`**, family "Easy Anti-Cheat" |

No admin, no write to our install directory, nothing left on disk. This is the
one measurement to keep from the whole item: the hard gate could be turned off by
an inherited environment variable and a text file.

### ✅ §S21 · The ANSI path, on the real Win32 calls (system ACP 1252)

A profile component the system code page cannot spell exists on disk and
`CreateFileW` opens it, while `CreateFileA` fails `ERROR_INVALID_NAME (123)`.
Under an ASCII profile the same file opens both ways — which is exactly why a dev
box cannot see this, and why it would have shipped.

**A measurement of my own that was wrong first.** The initial round-trip used
`[Text.Encoding]::Default`, which in .NET Core is **always UTF-8** and not the
process ANSI code page, so it reported no loss. Re-run against the real ACP, it
lost the characters. *Measuring the wrong API is indistinguishable from measuring
a working one.*

### ✅ §S21 · What the first floor actually covered

Measured against the shipped seed, the hand-written three-family floor held
**4 of 22 values, 2 of 5 groups, 0 of 5 name fragments** — so it closed "a crafted
file allows everything" and left "a crafted file removes most of the blocklist"
open. Recorded because the write-up read as though it bounded more than it did.
The floor is now generated from `rules/detection-rules.json` at build time and
carries all of it.

Two residuals measured rather than asserted:

- The known-folder path **is** still user-relocatable — the `User Shell Folders`
  key under `HKCU` is FullControl for the user. That is a persistent change
  affecting every application, not a per-launch variable, so the fix is a
  narrowing and is written down as one.
- Moving the layer to `SHGetKnownFolderPath` added `ole32` and `SHELL32` to its
  imports. Resident in **62%** and **61%** of inspectable processes respectively,
  so the layer takes on no meaningful new load-time surface.

### ✅ §S20 · `MoveFileEx` vs `ReplaceFileW` against a live reader

`MoveFileExW(MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING)` returns **`ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`** when
the destination is open by a reader holding the guard's exact share mode
(`READ|WRITE|DELETE`). `ReplaceFileW` succeeds. **This repository had prescribed
the failing one** — in a source comment and in the ledger — as guidance for
whoever built the seeder. A prescription nobody ran is a guess in the imperative
mood.

### ✅ §S20 · `rulesVersion` does not track the blocklist

The first seeder design replaced the installed file when the packaged seed was
strictly newer. Measured against this repository's own history of that file:
`31825cf` and `ba5355e` both changed the `anticheat` block **without** touching
`rulesVersion`, and `a4a2c63` — the only commit that bumped it — changed the block
**not at all**. The rule would have delivered none of the two changes it existed
for. The seeder records a hash of what it installed instead.

### ✅ §S20 · The seed half, on the machine's real rules location

Remove the file → the guard answers `RulesUnreadable`. Run the Agent → the guard
reads its rules and reaches check 1. Four Agent branches exercised against the
real location, with the machine's own file backed up and restored by hash:
already-current, installed-from-nothing, idempotent second run, corrupt file
replaced.

The feed half is untouched, so a rules edit still reaches no installed machine
until a release.

### 🔴 The canary harness lied three times before it caught anything

Kept because this file's rules ask for dead ends, and because this one produced
three confident greens in one session:

1. `ctest`/Catch2 with `-c "*name*"` **selects nothing and exits 0**, so every
   "the canary passed" was vacuous.
2. The rewritten check matched only Catch2's **failure** summary, so a genuinely
   green run parsed as "the filter selected nothing".
3. `build.ps1`'s throw escaped the harness and **left a canary edit on disk** —
   the next build then failed on an unrelated `/W4 /WX` unused-parameter warning,
   which was nearly diagnosed as the canary working.

Now: tag filters, an assertion that assertions actually ran, and `try`/`finally`
around the build. A canary that cannot go red is the defect it was written to
catch, one level up.

---

## 13 · Can the guard go RED against real anti-cheat? *(2026-08-04)*

Every real-machine verdict recorded before this section was `Allow` or an
*uncertainty* refusal. The only blocklist positive ever seen — `EasyAntiCheat_EOS`
as an installed-but-stopped service — was classified as a defect and deliberately
narrowed away. So nothing had ever shown that the module, driver, service or
directory tiers fire against a running commercial anti-cheat, and a gate that has
never been observed to refuse carries the same amount of information as one that
never refuses.

Measured against four real titles, unelevated. **`FlGuardEvaluate` and
`FlStaticPreScan` only — nothing was injected anywhere.**

### ✅ It goes red — through the SERVICE tier, and machine-wide

With Goose Goose Duck (Easy Anti-Cheat, Unity) actually running:

| Target | Verdict |
|---|---|
| `Goose Goose Duck` (pid) | `BlockedService`, family `Easy Anti-Cheat`, signal `EasyAntiCheat_EOS` |
| `GGDLauncher` | same |
| `EasyAntiCheat_EOS` | same |
| **a freshly spawned `hook-harness`, completely unrelated** | **same** |

State at the moment of measurement: service `EasyAntiCheat_EOS` **Running**,
driver `EasyAntiCheat_EOSSys` **Running**.

**The refusal is machine-wide, and that is worth stating plainly rather than
discovering.** Checks 2 and 2b do not depend on the target, so while any EAC
title is running FrameLedger refuses to inject into *anything* — a user with a
party game idling in the background cannot capture an unrelated single-player
title, and the signal names a game they are not playing. That is the correct
fail-closed posture (a live anti-cheat driver is a machine-wide hazard, which is
exactly what §S1's driver check exists for), but the user-facing text has to
explain it or it reads as a bug.

### 🔴 Check 1 structurally cannot see an EAC-protected game

Measured with the guard's own rights and flags
(`PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION | PROCESS_VM_READ`, `LIST_MODULES_ALL`):

| Process | Result |
|---|---|
| `Goose Goose Duck` | `OpenProcess` succeeds, **`EnumProcessModulesEx` fails with `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED (5)`** |
| `EasyAntiCheat_EOS` | `OpenProcess` fails with `5` |
| `GGDLauncher` | 62 modules readable, **none** matching any blocklist prefix or fuzzy fragment |

So the module tier's `EasyAntiCheat` entries can never fire on the process that
matters: the guard gets `kFailed` → `kProcessUnreadable`, which is a refusal for
"could not look", not for "found EAC". The handle opening while the enumeration
is denied is worth remembering — a probe that only checked `OpenProcess` would
have concluded the process was readable.

**The consequence for §S16:** the readable member of this title's tree is the
launcher, and the launcher carries nothing. The service check is doing all the
work.

### 🔴 Two whole families were missing, and one is kernel-level

| | |
|---|---|
| `ACE-BASE.sys`, `ACE-ADVT.sys` | Installed under `System32\drivers` by Neverness To Everness (Anti-Cheat Expert, **kernel level**). Matched **nothing** — the family was absent from `19_SAFETY`'s table and from the data |
| service `AntiCheatExpert Protection` | Registered. Matched nothing |
| `EasyAntiCheat_EOSSys` | Running as a **kernel driver**. Matched nothing in `drivers`; the refusal came from `services` instead |
| `NTEGlobal/driver/PGameProtectDriver_X64.sys` | A kernel driver shipped **inside the game install**. Matched nothing. Its name contains `protect`, but the fuzzy tier is modules-only and never looks at check 4's file and directory groups |

All four are now in the data and in `19_SAFETY` §Blocklist seed, with the
unmeasured siblings marked as such.

**Valve VAC remains absent, and CS2 measures `Allow`.** VAC is neither a
machine-wide driver nor a service; it is modules loaded into the game process,
which — per the previous section — is exactly what cannot be read. The route
`19_SAFETY` reserves for it is `blockedStoreIds` — check 3's **store-id half**,
which cannot be called (§S14). #52 wired the *executable* half; that changes
nothing here, because a renamed executable defeats a name list and the store-id
route is exactly why `19_SAFETY` reserves it. Recorded rather than papered over:
**a real VAC title is allowed by this guard today.**

### 🔴 The data addition alone changed nothing, and that is the sharper finding

Adding `PGameProtectDriver_X64.sys` made check 4 refuse when the scan started at
`NTEGlobal` — and still return `Allow` from the **install root**, which is where
check 4 actually runs (`ImageDirectory` → `ResolveInstallRoot`).

`kMaxPreScanDepth` was 2. Measured with a control tree carrying a known
blocklisted file at increasing depth:

| File at | Old cap | New cap |
|---|---|---|
| depth 0 | refuse | refuse |
| depth 1 | refuse | refuse |
| depth 2 | **Allow** | refuse |
| depth 3 | Allow | **Allow** |

The driver sits at depth 2. So the blocklist row was coverage on paper — a row
that cannot be reached from where the scan begins.

**The cap was measured before it moved, because it is a REFUSAL and not a
truncation:** overrunning `kMaxPreScanEntries = 4096` does not scan less, it
refuses the title. Across 67 installed titles the worst case is **506** entries
at the old reach and **729** at the new one — 18% of budget, 5.6x headroom.

### ✅ Proven on the whole corpus, both directions

The deeper pre-scan run against all 67 installed titles:

| Verdict | Count |
|---|---|
| `Allow` | 65 |
| `AntiCheatDirectory` (Goose Goose Duck) | 1 |
| `AntiCheatFile` (Neverness To Everness) | 1 |
| `PreScanFailed` | **0** |

Exactly the two anti-cheat titles refuse, nothing else does, and the deeper walk
produced no false refusal on any real install.

### What is still unmeasured

- Whether the module tier fires on **any** real anti-cheat. It could not be
  reached here: the one title whose modules are readable carries none.
- Whether the driver tier fires. `ACE-*` and `EasyAntiCheat*` are now in
  `drivers`, but both were **Stopped** during the measurement window that would
  have exercised it, and the EAC session was caught by the service check first.
  The driver rows are therefore data-complete and **behaviourally untested**.
- VAC, as above.

## Exit criteria

`15_ROADMAP` §P0. Nothing in P1 starts until all are met.

- [x] A throwaway build records a real session from a real offline game
      reporting **correct** upscaler, quality preset, render → output
      resolution, FG factor and RT state — verified against the game's own
      settings menu. **Met 2026-09-06 with one amendment, the owner's:** the
      quality preset reads `N/A` on every title, by measurement — Streamline's tags
      carry no size or preset on Direct3D 12, NVIDIA's override fields are the
      override's, XeSS is closed by licence — and an honest `N/A` where measurement
      is impossible is the *correct* value CLAUDE.md rule 7 asks for. Upscaler,
      render → output (where the vendor's call carries it), FG factor and RT state
      are verified against the menus of nine titles (§9). The owner closed 7a on

- [x] **Moved to the end of P1** (§R4, decided 2026-08-02) — ~~measured game FPS

## 14 · The P2 milestone and the FPS-impact run *(slots — the owner's runs)*

**Nothing below has been run.** The section exists because P2's code is finished and its two
remaining obligations are measurements a script cannot take: a real title, read against its own
settings menu, and a benchmark whose number only the operator can see. Written as empty slots with
the exact commands rather than left absent, so the next session cannot mistake "not measured" for
"not required" — the failure mode this file's own rules name first.

### 14.1 · The milestone session — Tier 1, a real title, against its menus

`15_ROADMAP` §P2: *"first real hooked session persisted with measured upscaler/RT data."*

**The technical half is met and is in the merge gate (2026-09-10, P2 PR-F):**
`AgentEndToEndTests` runs the shipped `FrameLedger.Agent.exe --console capture --exe hook-harness.exe`
and reads back one `sessions` row — tier 1, `d3d11`, > 100 frames, `guard_ticks_published ≥ 1`, the
blobs beside it, no `.partial` left. What the harness cannot supply is a *game*: it has no upscaler,
no frame generation and no ray tracing, so `upscaler`, `fg_mode` and `rt_flag` are honestly `N/A`
there. The milestone is the row where they are not.

**The run, when the owner takes it** (candidates from §9: Cyberpunk 2077, Lies of P, Cronos):

```
FrameLedger.Agent --console consent grant  --exe "<title>.exe"      # type the phrase
FrameLedger.Agent --console launch         --exe "<title>.exe" --seconds 600
FrameLedger.Agent --console sessions --last 1
```

| Field | Read from the row | The game's own menu | Agree? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `upscaler` | | | |
| `upscaler_quality` | | | *(`N/A` is the measured answer on every title so far — §9, P0 exit criterion 1)* |
| `render_w` × `render_h` → `output_w` × `output_h` | | | |
| `fg_mode` / `fg_factor` | | | |
| `rt_flag` | | | |
| `telemetry_source` | | *(expect `l1+lhm+nvapi` on this box since PR-E2)* | |

**One launch per capture** (HANDOFF §Traps): a title measured off / ×2 / ×4 is three launches.

### 14.2 · §S1's launcher-fronted title — launch mode and the descendant election

The election is built (P2 PR-F, `DescendantElection`) and unit-tested against fabricated snapshots;
what has never happened is a real launcher spawning a real game under it. An Epic- or
Ubisoft-fronted title is the case: the consented executable exits or never presents, the guard
answers `LaunchTargetExited` / `LaunchNoPresentationRuntime` with nothing injected, and the Agent
then elects the newest tracked descendant and attaches.

**The elected image needs its own consent record** — a launcher's consent does not extend to what it
spawns — so the run is: `consent grant` the launcher, `launch` it, read the `election:` line, then
`consent grant` the game the election named and `launch` again.

| | |
|---|---|
| Title / launcher | |
| Guard's answer for the launcher | |
| `election:` line | |
| Session row for the elected image | |

### 14.3 · FPS impact ≤ 0.5 % — `14_TESTING` §Hook overhead item 2

The last thing P1 owes (§R4 moved it here because it needs P2's drain and recorder). Run
`tools/fps-impact-runbook.ps1`; it prints the block that replaces this one.

```
./tools/fps-impact-runbook.ps1 -Exe "<title>.exe" -GameArgs "-benchmark" -Seconds 600
```

| Run | Leg | Game avg FPS | Agent CPU (% of a core) | Agent RSS (MB) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ON | | | |
| 2 | ON | | | |
| 3 | ON | | | |
| 1 | OFF | | | |
| 2 | OFF | | | |
| 3 | OFF | | | |

Gates: FPS delta ≤ 0.5 %, Agent CPU ≤ 1 % of a core, Agent RSS ≤ 150 MB. **Overlay resident ≤ 8 MB is
not measured by the runbook** and is left blank rather than guessed: it is a module inside the game
process, and reading the target's memory is what CLAUDE.md rule 4 forbids — an external tool that
inspects module sizes is the way to fill it.

### 14.4 · §H7's six overlays — still owner-only

Unchanged by P2 and repeated here because it is the other measurement no PR can close: the
compare-and-restore path is proven against a fixture (`ctest fl_unhook_inline`), and §H7 still asks
for one capture with each of the six overlays actually resident on the dev machine.
