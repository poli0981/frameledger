# 13 — CI/CD

FrameLedger uses the **`poli0981/.github` ops repo** where its templates fit, and repo-local workflows where they do not. `ci.yml` is repo-local **by necessity, not preference**: the ops repo's `reusable-desktop-csharp.yml` runs `dotnet restore` / `build` / `test` directly and exposes no input for a native pre-step, MSVC setup, or the Vulkan SDK. FrameLedger's build is mixed-toolchain and native-first, and `12_BUILD.md` §Local quality gate commits to CI running *the identical script* as local — a promise a pure-managed template cannot keep. CodeQL and release still call the ops repo.

> ⚠ Known gotcha (learned on earlier migrations): caller stubs **must declare explicit `permissions:` blocks** — permissions do not inherit into reusable workflows. Every stub below lists its own.

## Workflows (`.github/workflows/`)

### `ci.yml` — push to `main` + all PRs · **repo-local**
- `runs-on: windows-latest`, .NET SDK pinned by `global.json` via `actions/setup-dotnet`, MSVC via `ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd`, NuGet cached.
- Single step of substance: **`./build.ps1 check`** — the same script, with the same switches (none), a developer runs before pushing. The gate list lives in `12_BUILD` §Local quality gate, **once**, rather than being restated here where it goes stale.
- ~~**`-SkipIntegration` is the one place local and CI deliberately differ**~~ — **gone since 2026-09-06.** From 2026-08-05 CI passed it for a measured reason: §S16 puts the injecting process's ancestors in the scan set, a .NET test host loads `System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData.dll`, and the guard's `protect` fragment refused our own harness (§S19(b)). The signer half now verifies that module's embedded signature offline and reads `O=Microsoft Corporation` on the compiled-in bound, so the nine `Category=Integration` cases run here, and a green CI IS evidence for the managed drain and the capture host's end-to-end behaviour. The switch remains in `build.ps1`, loud, for a developer who must.
- **The hosted runner refuses guard scans intermittently — THREE failures in eight gate runs, measured
  2026-09-10 while merging P2's stack.** Every one was an `Category=Integration` case, every one passed on
  a re-run of the identical commit, and none was caused by the code under review. Two distinct shapes, and
  the second is not §S19(b):
    - `ShmDrainIntegrationTests.AnUnhookRequestStopsTheCaptureSideAndTheDrainCanSeeIt` at
      `GuardedInjectAsync(...).IsAllowed` — the guard refusing our own harness, §S19(b)'s shape.
    - `CaptureHostEndToEndTests.WhenTheTargetExitsTheHostStopsAndSaysWhy` with
      **`ProcessTreeUnavailable — could not establish the scan set`**: the guard could not walk the
      ancestors at all. That is a *different* failure from the fragment/signer one, and §S19(b) does not
      cover it. A runner under load whose process enumeration fails is the obvious hypothesis and it is
      **untested** — nobody has instrumented it.
  So: §S19(b)'s refusal is **reduced, not gone**, and it is not the only way a scan fails here. The
  earlier version of this bullet said "one run in the low tens", written after the first failure and
  wrong by the end of the same evening; it is corrected rather than quietly deleted, because a frequency
  claim made from one observation is exactly the shape this file keeps catching.
  **Re-run before investigating**; if it reproduces, read the module list and the scan-set reason, not the test.
- **A re-run ERASES the evidence, which is why the count above had to be kept by hand.**
  `gh run rerun --failed` updates the original run's conclusion, so `gh run list` showed **18 success, 1
  cancelled, 0 failed** across the twenty runs that contained all three failures above. Anyone measuring
  this flake rate from the run history will measure zero. Read the job logs, or keep the tally as it
  happens.
- **The step that would diagnose it runs AFTER the thing it diagnoses, so a gate failure skips it.**
  The signer probe below is step 8; the quality gate is step 7, and the job stops there. On the
  2026-09-10 failure the probe therefore printed nothing, which is the one run where its output would
  have named the refusing module. Moving it before the gate (or giving it `if: always()`) is a one-line
  change nobody has made, recorded here rather than done quietly in an unrelated PR.
- **Signer probe step** (2026-09-06): `fl-probe-signer` runs as its own step after the gate — `continue-on-error`, a measurement and not a gate — because `ctest fl_signer_probe` passes on a regular expression and prints nothing, so §S19(b)'s CI leg was never readable from the log. Its answers are read off this step.
- Uploads coverage artifacts.
- **Changelog gate**, on pull requests only: the changed-file list comes from GitHub's own view of the PR — not `git diff`, so a shallow checkout cannot silently produce a short one — and an empty list is refused rather than read as "no `src/` changes". It is a **step of the required `check` job** and deliberately not a job of its own: `main`'s required contexts are exactly `check` and the two `analyze` jobs, so a new job would go red while the merge button stayed green, which is what already makes `Rules / validate` advisory (§S23-2).

> **Three claims in this section were false and are corrected 2026-08-06.** There is no Vulkan SDK
> step and there will not be one — the Khronos headers are vendored. `resx-audit` does not exist and

- **Licence guard:** `tools/license-check` fails the build if a vendored dependency is missing its licence copy, or if Intel IGCL / AMD ADLX headers appear anywhere in the tree (`docs/18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS.md` §Vendor SDKs we deliberately do not use). Licensing regressions are silent and hard to unwind later — catch them at PR time.
- **Placeholder guard:** fails if any `{{` token survives in `README.md` or `legal/*.md`. Those are shipped, legally operative documents (FR-11 displays them in the first-run Legal Gate); an unsubstituted `{{DEVELOPER_NAME}}` in an EULA is not a cosmetic defect.
- `permissions: contents: read`.

### `codeql.yml` — push, PR, weekly cron · **repo-local**

> **Not a caller stub, which this heading said until 2026-08-06.** `codeql.yml`'s own header says
> the opposite: the ops repo has `codeql-mixed.yml`, but C++ needs manual build mode driven by the
> CMake preset and that input surface has not been verified. The paragraph below already anticipated
> exactly this outcome; the heading was never updated when it happened.
- Languages: `csharp` **and `cpp`** (manual build mode for C++, driven by the CMake preset). The native layer is where memory-safety bugs would live; excluding it would defeat the purpose. Verify the mixed template exposes a C++ build-command input; if it does not, this one goes repo-local too.
- `permissions: security-events: write, contents: read`.

### `release.yml` — on tag `v*` · **PLANNED, NOT PRESENT**

> `.github/workflows/` contains `ci.yml`, `codeql.yml` and `rules-publish.yml`. There is no release
> automation at all: the publish commands exist only as a fenced block in `12_BUILD` §Publish &
> package, and **nothing in this repository has ever run `dotnet publish`** — which is why
> `out/app`'s real contents had never been asserted by anything until
> `tools/package-closure-check.ps1` started walking the reference closure statically. Recorded
> 2026-08-06 rather than left describing a workflow that does not exist.
- Build + test (same script, native first) → publish App+Agent self-contained → ~~verify PresentMon SHA-256~~ *(retired 2026-08-27 — the console binary is not bundled; owner decision, `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §G)* → **verify VERSIONINFO present on `FrameLedger.Overlay.dll` and `FrameLedger.VkLayer.dll`** (identifiability is a safety requirement, `19_SAFETY`) → `vpk pack` → generate `SHA256SUMS.txt` → create GitHub Release with Velopack assets + checksums, release notes from `CHANGELOG.md` section.
- Optional final step: submit installer hash to VirusTotal and append the report link to release notes (helps unsigned-binary trust).
- `permissions: contents: write`.

### `rules-publish.yml` — on change to `rules/detection-rules.json` in `main`
- Runs `tools/rules-validate` and fails on anti-cheat removals. The raw file on `main` **is** the distribution endpoint (05_DETECTION), so this workflow only gates correctness.

  > **There is no `rulesVersion` bump check, and this line used to claim one.**
  > `rules-validate.ps1` checks the field's *format* and nothing compares it
  > against the merge base, so a blocklist edit ships with the version untouched —
  > measured on this repository's own history, that is what every commit that
  > changed the `anticheat` block actually did, while the one commit that bumped
  > `rulesVersion` changed the block not at all.
  >
  > Recorded rather than built, because nothing depends on the ordering: §S20's
  > seeder deliberately uses **provenance** (a hash of what it installed) rather
  > than version comparison, precisely because that history falsifies the
  > comparison. A monotonicity gate is still worth having before anything else
  > starts trusting the field — an unbuilt gate described as existing is the
  > defect this note replaces.

  > **The validator does not evaluate rules**, and this line used to say it ran
  > "against fixtures". It checks the schema, the imperative constraints, the
  > parser's capacity bounds, and **fixture coverage** — that every rule id has a
  > fixture and every fixture has a rule. The evaluation is
  > `RuleFixtureCorpusTests` in `ci.yml`'s `check` job, which drives the real
  > evaluator through the real probe. Both halves run on the same PR; only the
  > coverage half fires on a rules-only change, which is why the two are
  > described separately rather than as one gate.
- **The `anticheat` block gets extra scrutiny:** schema-valid, non-empty, no entry removed without a justification in the PR body. Removing a blocklist entry is a safety change and requires the same review as a security fix.

## Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`)

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: nuget
    directory: /
    schedule: { interval: weekly }
    groups: { minor-and-patch: { update-types: [minor, patch] } }
  - package-ecosystem: github-actions
    directory: /
    schedule: { interval: weekly }
```

Central package management makes Dependabot PRs single-file diffs.

## Branch & release policy

- `main` protected: CI + CodeQL required, linear history, no direct pushes.
- Release: update `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog format) → tag `vX.Y.Z` → `release.yml` does the rest → smoke-test the produced installer on a clean Win 10 VM + Win 11 (manual checklist in 14_TESTING §Release smoke).
- Pre-releases: `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` tags mark the GitHub release as pre-release; Velopack stable channel ignores them (explicit beta channel is v2 backlog).

## Repo hygiene checklist (one-time setup)

- [ ] Add repo-local `ci.yml`; add caller stubs for CodeQL + release pointing at `poli0981/.github` with the explicit permissions above
- [ ] Enable Dependabot alerts + security updates
- [ ] Add `bug_report.yml`, `feature_request.yml` issue forms; PR template referencing CLAUDE.md definition-of-done
- [ ] Branch protection as above
- [ ] Repo topics: `windows`, `wpf`, `benchmark`, `fps`, `presentmon`, `game-performance`
