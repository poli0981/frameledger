# 15 — Roadmap

The hook rewrite front-loads risk: almost everything uncertain is in P0/P1. That is deliberate — a hook layer that doesn't work is not a feature you discover in week four.

> **Read `docs/20_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` alongside this file.** It holds the audit
> findings that P0 exists to answer. The §R resequencing proposals are now folded
> into the order below rather than sitting as a proposal: the guard is item 0,
> the Vulkan passthrough test is item 1, and the two licence checks — which
> needed no hardware and could each have invalidated an entire telemetry layer —
> were run first and came back clear.

## P0 — Spike · *gates everything*

Findings written to `docs/spike-notes.md`. Nothing in P1 starts until the exit criteria pass.

> **Status as of 2026-08-20.** Items **2, 3, 5 and 6 done**; **4 partly**; 0 and 1 partly.
> Written 2026-08-27, because the block below is dated 2026-08-06 and eleven PRs landed
> after it — the upscaler identity and params hooks, the frame-generation counter, and both
> ray-tracing hooks — while this file said none of them had. **What moved:** item 6 is done
> and item 4 is no longer untouched. **What did not:** item 7 is blocked on §S31, item 8 has
> no code at all, and exit criterion 1 still reads **3 of 5** at its best (`spike-notes` §8).
>
> **Re-read 2026-09-04:** item 7 ✅ (the FG factor is measured, §S31 row P1), item 8's L2 half is written and measured (§M5 row R1), and exit criterion 1 reads **4 of 5** on Cyberpunk 2077 — the quality preset is the one value left, and `HANDOFF` item 7 carries the three things the next session does.
>
> **P0 CLOSED 2026-09-06 (owner).** Criterion 1 met with the quality preset amended to an
> honest `N/A` (`spike-notes` §Exit criteria carries why); criterion 2 met — §S24 counts zero
> S-items against it, with 🚫 S23-2 outside any PR. The measurement path this phase exists to
> prove runs end to end in an unshipped capture host, on nine titles. **P1 starts.**
>
> The 08-06 block below is kept and is now wrong in one specific clause — it says the writer
> *"records `measuredMask = FL_MEASURED_OUTPUT_RES | FL_MEASURED_PRESENT_ARGS` and nothing
> else"*. It records upscaler identity, upscaler params, frame-generation counts and ray
> tracing as well. Struck in place rather than deleted, because *how* this file went stale is

>
> **Status as of 2026-08-06.** Items **2, 3 and 5 done**; 0 and 1 partly. **The
> capture path that P2 owns on paper now exists, unshipped**, and is what makes the
> remaining P0 work purely about hooks: `FrameLedger.CaptureHost` drives
> `HookedCaptureGate` → `FlGuardedInject` → `ShmRingReader` → drain with
> `GuardSupervisor` beside it, so `guardTicks` advances from a non-test binary for
> the first time. It moves **no roadmap item** — items 4, 6 and 7 still need feature
> hooks, and the writer still measures nothing but output resolution and its own
> present arguments — which is why this line still reads the same below.
>
> **Status as of 2026-08-05.** Items **2, 3 and 5 done**; 0 and 1 partly. The

> happened. Everything still open needs either **feature hooks that do not exist
> yet** (4, 6, 7 — a throwaway build, per the exit criteria, not all of P1),
> absent hardware (8, and the AMD/Intel half of the capability matrix), or is P1
> by construction (the layer's presentation hooks). Item 0's residual is check 3's
> **store-id half** — the executable half was wired in #52, and that half is blocked
> by design rather than pending (§S14).
>
> **The Overlay stopped being a scaffold on 2026-08-05, and this file was the last
> to hear about it.** Five PRs (#40–#44) landed the SPSC ring, the mapping and
> handshake, the DXGI present hook, the safety stop and supervision loss, and

> with no documentation edit anywhere.** For a day this section, `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS`
> §S6, `spike-notes.md` §8 and `legal/DISCLAIMER.md` all described a DLL with no

0. **The guard.** Module + driver enumeration, blocklist matching, fail-closed behaviour on every error path. **Moved from item 8**: items 1 and 6 below inject into real games, and CLAUDE.md rule 2 plus P1's own "it ships before the first real injection, not after" both forbid that ordering. **◐ Every documented check now has a call site; one half of one check does not.** `EvaluateImpl` runs checks 1, 2, 2b, 3 (executable half) and 4 — five, not four, because 2b (`services`) is the only tier ever measured firing on real anti-cheat and every count that says "four" omits it. The guard is built (`FrameLedger.Injector`, native per §S13(a)), owns the chokepoint, and its fail-closed matrix is Catch2-driven. The injection primitive landed after it, in that order. Reached from managed code through one P/Invoke facade — never a second matcher (§S15). Evidence: `spike-notes.md` §1; §S7, §S8, §S16 closed.

   > **This line said ✅ DONE, and it was wrong in a way worth recording.**
   > `19_SAFETY` specifies four pre-injection checks. **Check 4** (the static

1. **Vulkan layer passthrough.** Minimal implicit layer registered under `HKCU`, with the opt-in checks that keep it passthrough for non-enabled processes. **Moved from item 7**: a passthrough bug loads FrameLedger into every Vulkan process on the machine, which is the highest blast radius in the spike. **◐ Gates done, interception not started.** `enable_environment` measured against loader 1.4.357, blast radius verified, in-layer blocklist self-scan built and proven both directions. `vkQueuePresentKHR` is **not** hooked — that is P1, and §S2's in-layer supervision check lands with it.
2. **Hook viability.** `hook-harness` (D3D11 + D3D12) + MinHook: dummy-device vtable probe, verify present indices at runtime, install/uninstall cleanly, measure per-present cost. Confirm `/MT` DLL loads into a real (offline, non-AC) game without incident. **✅ DONE.** Vtable indices proved by behaviour (§H4), unhook proved not to clobber a later hooker (§H7), per-present cost measured at 8.4 ns against a 1,000 ns budget — and **the `/MT` DLL is now loaded into a real title**: Lies of P, attach mode, guard passing, module verified present by re-enumeration, game still rendering afterwards (`spike-notes.md` §7).

   > **Attach mode only when this ran.** Launch mode was blocked by §S18 — the
   > Agent is the game's parent and hosted `FrameLedger.Guard.dll`, whose name
   > trips the guard's own `guard` fragment. Found by this run, decided

3. **The accuracy baseline.** Build a **minimal static-hint detector** — passive file/module scanning, no injection — as the thing item 4 measures against. Added to P0 scope 2026-08-02 (`20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §M9): the "old detection" this roadmap assumed as a baseline does not exist in this repository, and without it the comparison below cannot be made and ADR-7's founding claim is unfalsifiable. It needs no guard and no injection, so it can be built at any point before item 4. **✅ DONE — both halves, and run on real installs.** The module half is `fl-baseline-probe` (ctest `fl_baseline_probe`, proven in both directions, reusing the guard's own measured enumerator). The inference half is `Domain.Detection.RuleEvaluator` over `Infrastructure.Detection.GameFileProbe`, with a fixture corpus and both an over-match and an under-match canary. Measured against **three real titles** — Deadly Heart Gambit, Lies of P, Alan Wake 2 (`spike-notes.md` §8).

   > **This line said "the rule evaluator is not built" until 2026-08-03**, after
   > the PR that built it. Recording the drift rather than quietly correcting it:

   > (Steam `.acf`, GOG `.info`, Epic `.item`) — every platform rule is
   > `sibling_glob`/`path_contains`, so identification is unaffected but
   > **`store_id` is null for every title**. No SQLite, so nothing is persisted

   > not working.

   > **A finding from building it, recorded before the README is drafted:** the
   > baseline can answer **none** of item 4's four runtime questions (upscaler

   > `nvngx_dlss.dll` means the title *can* use DLSS, not that it is on. So

4. **The accuracy question — the reason this rewrite exists.** On the dev machine (RTX 5080), verify against ≥ 3 real offline titles that hooks recover: NGX/Streamline feature identity, render vs output resolution, quality preset, and DLSS-G activity. Compare against what the item-3 baseline reports. **Quantify the improvement** — this number justifies the whole trade-off and belongs in the README.

   > **◐ The HOOKED half is measured; the COMPARISON is not, and the difference is not
   > paperwork.** Five captures across four real titles landed 2026-08-20 and every verdict
   > agrees with the game's own settings menu (`spike-notes` §8's table, empty until then).
   > **Two things keep this ◐ rather than ✅:**
   >
   > - **The baseline side cannot be run.** This item's text says *"compare against what the
   >   item-3 baseline reports"*, and `StaticGameDetector` has **no runnable vehicle** — every
   >   construction of it is in `tests/`. So the comparison has one arm. `HANDOFF` item 5
   >   records this as uncosted; this file had never said it at all.
   > - **The README sentence does not exist**, and it is the artifact this item is for. It is
   >   **not a percentage** — item 3 and `spike-notes` §8 already record that the baseline
   >   cannot answer four of the five questions *at all*, which is the defensible claim.
   >
   > An item whose deliverable does not exist may not read ✅ on the strength of the
   > measurements that were supposed to feed it.
5. **Vendor SDK reality check. ✅ DONE.** Measured across 34 distinct modules in 162 files from installed titles; `tools/vendor-exports.ps1` regenerates and `docs/vendor-exports.json` is committed. `17_HOOK_ENGINE` §Upscaling is corrected and its caveat discharged. **It needed no feature hooks** — it reads files with `dumpbin` — so the status header above was wrong to group it with 4/6/7. The finding: `sl.common.dll` exports the NGX parameter **accessors**, while the NGX core exports only the **factories**, so NGX-direct titles need a different hook class (`17_HOOK_ENGINE` §The NGX parameter surface splits into two hook classes).
6. **RT detection.** Harness + a real DXR title: `DispatchRays` counting *and* `BuildRaytracingAccelerationStructure`; verify the AS-build path catches an inline-RayQuery title that dispatch counting misses. **✅ DONE 2026-08-20.** Both detours are on `ID3D12GraphicsCommandList4`, and the discriminating claim is **proved rather than asserted**: `ctest fl_guard`'s two harness arms differ by one recorded call, and `--hold-presenting-rayquery` reports `AsBuildObserved = 60` against `DispatchObserved = **0**` — a writer with only the dispatch hook sees nothing there and its silence is indistinguishable from a real negative (`spike-notes` §6). Four real titles agree with their own settings menus, `Yes` twice and `No` twice. **Carry the trap forward:** a command list's first `Reset()` swaps in a per-object vtable in which the driver has taken `DispatchRays` over, so the first version of this hook installed, published its family bit and never fired — `HANDOFF` §item 4.
7. **Frame Generation ground truth.** ✅ **DONE 2026-09-04.** The producer is `sl.interposer.dll!slGetNewFrameToken` counted on a new frame index (#103, #105); validated on Cyberpunk 2077's own off / ×3 / ×4 at 1.00 / 2.99 / 3.99 and Hell Is Us ×4 at 4.00 (§S31 row P1), `fg_factor` published, `none` reachable by counting, and `tokens/batch = 1.00` answered §S31's question with a second count. Not compared against ETW — there is no Tier 2 — but against the titles' own settings, which is what the P0 exit criterion asks for. *(The item as it stood while blocked:)* ~~Compare rung 1 (FG feature evaluations per present) against Tier-2 ETW `FrameType` on a DLSS-G title.~~ **BLOCKED ON A PRODUCER, not on tooling, measured 2026-08-15:** `slEvaluateFeature(kFeatureDLSS_G)` is never called by Cyberpunk 2077 (0 across ~14,000 Streamline batches at four FG settings), so rung 1 emits nothing for ETW to be compared against. What DID track the setting is `presents / batch` — 1.000 / 2.000 / 4.000 against off / ×2 / ×4 — but a batch is not an application frame and that premise has no independent oracle. `docs/HANDOFF.md` item 3 carries the candidate producers and the decision nobody has taken; `spike-notes` §9 carries the numbers. **AND THE ETW HALF IS NOW RETIRED, 2026-08-27.** The comparison this item asks for was attempted: three legs, three game launches, and PresentMon classified **every** frame `Application` at ×2 and ×4 while agreeing with our own hook on the present rate to within 0.3% — §S31 row **P2**. So rung 1 emits nothing and rung 2 cannot see NVIDIA frame generation either; this item has no instrument on either side, and `03_METRICS` rung 2 is narrowed accordingly. What that leaves is a hook-route decision with no oracle behind it (`HANDOFF` item 3). ~~rung 2 (`GetFrameStatistics` present delta)~~ was removed as structurally impossible, not merely unreliable (`03_METRICS` §Frame Generation). Driver-level FG (AFMF) is undetectable at Tier 1 in v1; whether PresentMon 2.x `FrameType` sees it at Tier 2 is `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §M1 — and is untestable on this dev machine, which has no AMD GPU.
8. **Telemetry layering.** Fill the `18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS` capability matrix on real hardware:
   - L1 baseline (DXGI + PDH counters) working vendor-neutrally; decide whether the `D3DKMT` perf-data probe is stable enough on Win 10 **and** Win 11 to keep. **🅓 Deferred to Win 11 only, 2026-08-05** — one machine, and it is Win 11. Win 10 22H2 stays a supported floor and is explicitly unmeasured; the deferral holds only for as long as the probe stays non-load-bearing, which `18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS` §L1 now states as the condition rather than as advice.
   - L2: which fields LibreHardwareMonitor actually returns per vendor, and **whether GPU sensors work unelevated without PawnIO** — this decides whether the default unelevated Agent has temperatures. **◐ NVIDIA measured 2026-09-03: yes (§M5 row R1), eight fields unelevated, `LhmTelemetrySource` written.** AMD / Intel remain 🅓 (§R5/§R6).
   - L3: NVAPI linked from vendored MIT headers; Reflex latency, throttle reasons, per-domain utilisation.
   - ~~**Licence confirmations:** LHM free of MPL-2.0 Exhibit B; NVAPI SPDX blocks intact~~ — **done before P0 began, both clear** (`spike-notes.md` §0). `tools/license-check` is in place and proven to fail on a planted violation.

*(The former items 7 "Vulkan layer" and 8 "Guard prototype" are now items 1 and 0. §R1/§R2 are folded in, not pending.)*

**Exit criteria:** a throwaway build records a real session from a real offline game reporting *correct* upscaler, quality preset, render→output resolution, FG factor and RT state — verified against the game's own settings menu. *(Met 2026-09-06; the preset is an honest `N/A` by measurement — `spike-notes` §Exit criteria.)*

> **The FPS-impact criterion moves to the end of P1** (`20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §R4,

## P1 — Native core (1.5 weeks)
`FrameLedger.Overlay` proper: hook installation for D3D11/12/9/OGL, feature hooks, ring writer, fault policy, unhook path, native logging. `FrameLedger.Injector` with launch + attach modes. Struct mirror + Catch2 tests. Vulkan layer to parity — `vkQueuePresentKHR` plus the in-layer supervision check §S2 gates on it.

## P2 — Capture pipeline (1 week)
Agent: watcher, tier selection, injection orchestration, shm drain, telemetry poller (NVAPI first), session recorder, segments, `.partial` recovery, ~~Tier-2 `EtwFrameSource` retained as fallback.~~ **There is nothing to retain: Tier 2 has no mechanism as of 2026-08-27** (§G). `EtwFrameSource` is a port with no adapter, and P2 should not be planned as though writing one were scoped. SQLite v2 schema + migrations. Domain metric calculators + golden tests. **Milestone: first real hooked session persisted with measured upscaler/RT data.** *Technical half reached 2026-09-10 (P2 PR-F): the shipped `FrameLedger.Agent.exe --console capture` against `hook-harness` ends as one hooked `sessions` row, in the merge gate (`AgentEndToEndTests`); the real-title half is PR-G's, the owner's run.*

## P3 — UI (1 week)
WPF UI shell (`16_WPFUI_SYNTAX`), library, per-game hooking consent flow, Dashboard live card showing *measured* settings, session summary, ScottPlot charts, game detail tabs, Compare with tier guarding, segment ribbon, tri-state chips with override, refusal/degradation/unhook notices as first-class UI.

## P4 — Detection & product polish (1 week)
Static rules engine + `detection-rules.json` (engines, platforms, capabilities, **anticheat blocklist**) + validator + fixtures; store auto-import; capability-vs-measured UI separation; i18n en/vi/ja; Legal Gate; Velopack + updater (with the hooked-session deferral); bug bundle incl. overlay logs; tray + toasts; Settings; DB maintenance; accessibility pass.

## P5 — Ship (3–4 days)
CI/CD with the native build; CodeQL (C# + C++); Dependabot; CHANGELOG; README with the P0 accuracy comparison — **which is not a percentage, and this line used to send its author looking for one**. The decision is recorded under item 3 and in `spike-notes.md` §8: the baseline can answer **none** of item 4's four runtime questions, so the defensible claim is *"the baseline cannot answer four of these five questions at all"*, not *"N% more accurate"*. Overhead + tier cross-validation measurements; release smoke on clean VMs; `v0.1.0-beta.1`.

**Total ≈ 5.5–6.5 weeks full-time** — roughly 1.5–2 weeks more than the ETW design, which is the honest price of the accuracy.

## v1.1 — earned features (only after the data path is stable)

- **In-game overlay** (FR-15): we are already in the process; draw live FPS/frametime/upscaler/RT state. Opt-in per game, off by default. Borderless and fullscreen-flip both handled since we own the swapchain.
- **PSO stutter deep-dive**: attribute compile stalls to specific pipeline creations with a timeline.
- ~~Unknown-game suggestion (Tier 2 only — never suggests hooking).~~ **Struck 2026-08-28:** the parenthesis meant "suggest it from passive measurement", and Tier 2 measures nothing. Any such suggestion would now come from static hints alone, which is a different feature with a different confidence story.
- Per-segment comparison ("before/after I changed DLSS Quality → Balanced, mid-session").

## v2 backlog

- ~~PresentMon Service + API2 for a richer Tier 2~~ — **struck 2026-08-27**, and the shape hardened 2026-08-28: v1's ladder has two rungs and Tier 2 is not a measurement. What v2 may want is **a no-injection measurement at all** — which would restore two things at once: the FG oracle §S31 spent four attempts looking for, and `14_TESTING`'s Tier-1 accuracy cross-check, which is struck for the same reason (§G)
- **YouTube overlay export**: frametime/FPS graph as transparent PNG sequence for DaVinci Resolve benchmark videos (SkullMute workflow)
- CapFrameX-compatible CSV import/export
- Microsoft Store / Game Pass titles (packaged-app injection constraints)
- AFK segmentation via `GetLastInputInfo`
- GPU frame time via timestamp queries (needs care: injecting queries into the game's command lists is more invasive than anything in v1 — needs its own risk review)
- Beta update channel; ARM64

## Permanently out of scope

Evasion of any kind; game memory access; kernel drivers; hardware control; online/competitive titles. See `19_SAFETY_AND_ANTICHEAT.md` — these are not "later", they are never.
