# 19 — Safety & anti-cheat policy

FrameLedger injects a DLL into game processes. That is a legitimate, mainstream technique (RTSS, Special K, OBS Game Capture, ReShade, Steam/Discord overlays all do it) — but it carries one real risk that falls entirely on the user: **an anti-cheat system may flag, block, or ban an account.** This document defines the guard rails that make that risk manageable, and the things this project will deliberately never build.

## Design principle

> A performance tool should be **easy for anti-cheat to see and identify**, and should **refuse to run** where it isn't welcome.

Every decision below follows from that. The failure mode we are engineering against is not "anti-cheat detected us" — that is fine and expected. It is "a user got banned because our tool loaded somewhere it shouldn't have."

## What we will never build (rule 3 in CLAUDE.md)

These are permanently out of scope. A PR implementing any of them is rejected regardless of quality:

- Manual mapping / reflective loading, or any injection that bypasses `LoadLibrary`
- Erasing or corrupting PE headers of the loaded module
- Unlinking the module from the PEB loader lists
- Hiding, renaming, or randomizing the DLL, its exports, or its shared-memory object names
- Thread hiding (`NtSetInformationThread`/`ThreadHideFromDebugger`) or debugger-evasion tricks
- Signature-breaking obfuscation/packing of our own binaries
- Any "stealth mode", "bypass" setting, or documentation explaining how to defeat the guard below
- Reading or writing game memory outside the arguments of APIs we hooked
- Kernel drivers of our own

The DLL ships with its real filename, a populated VERSIONINFO block (`CompanyName`, `ProductName=FrameLedger`, version), and named kernel objects that clearly say `FrameLedger`. Being identifiable is a feature.

## The anti-cheat guard (hard gate)

Implemented in `FrameLedger.Injector` and reached from managed code through a thin P/Invoke facade — one implementation, never two (`20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §S15). Runs **before every injection**, and again periodically for **every Tier-1 session**, injected or layered.

> "During a hooked session" was the original wording, and it excluded Vulkan by
> accident: those titles are captured by a Khronos layer and nothing is ever
> injected into them. The periodic re-scan is scoped to the *tier*, not to the
> mechanism.

### Pre-injection checks (all must pass)

1. **Target module scan** — enumerate loaded modules of the target process (`EnumProcessModulesEx`, read-only handle: `PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION | PROCESS_VM_READ`). Match against the blocklist below by filename.

2. **System driver scan** — enumerate loaded kernel drivers for always-on anti-cheat drivers that gate the whole machine (e.g. Vanguard's `vgk`). Present → refuse for **all** titles while it is running, not just the matching game.

3. **Rules blocklist** — `detection-rules.json` carries `anticheat.blockedExecutables` (exe names) and `anticheat.blockedStoreIds` (Steam appids etc.) for known competitive/online titles, updatable independently of app releases (`05_DETECTION` §Rules updates).

4. **Multiplayer heuristic** — if the pre-launch file scan finds an anti-cheat SDK shipped alongside the game (e.g. EOS anti-cheat binaries, `EasyAntiCheat/` directory) even when not currently loaded → refuse and explain.

Any check failing ⇒ **injection is refused**. The UI shows which check fired and offers Tier-2 (ETW) capture instead, which requires no injection — but does require an elevated Agent, so the offer must state that plainly and fall through to Tier 3 rather than appearing to succeed and recording nothing (`04_CAPTURE` §Frame source abstraction).

### The payload is checked too, and for a long time it was not

Checks 1–4 all answer *"is it safe to be inside this process"*. **None of them
asks what we are putting there**, and until 2026-08-04 nothing did: the exported
`FlGuardedInject` took a caller-supplied `dllPath` and asked only whether a file
existed at it. Measured through the shipped `FrameLedger.Guard.dll` with no test
seam, `C:\Windows\System32\winmm.dll` went into a live process and the verdict
was `Allow`. That is the standalone injector `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §S9 refused to
ship, re-exported with a published calling convention — the worst possible shape
under this document's own threat model, because an anti-cheat vendor auditing the
binary would find a general-purpose loader and the rational response is to block
FrameLedger outright.

So there is now a fifth thing the guard establishes before it injects: **the
payload resolves into the same directory the guard's own code was loaded from**,
compared by file id, through symlinks and 8.3 names and junctions. Refusal is
`Reason::kPayloadNotOurs`. A seam that cannot answer refuses, exactly as
everywhere else here.

It is deliberately **not** listed as "check 5". Checks 1–4 are numbered in
`05_DETECTION`, in the managed mirror and in the reason codes, and renumbering a
gate is how stored values start meaning something else. It is a precondition of
the injection primitive, not a fifth question about the title.

**What this does not buy**, stated here rather than left to be assumed:

- It proves *where the bytes live*, not that they are `FrameLedger.Overlay.dll`.
  Whoever can write to that directory can already replace the guard itself, so
  the check is exactly as strong as the install location — and the project ships
  unsigned (CLAUDE.md rule 9), so nothing attests to that directory's contents.
- It is not atomic with the load: the remote `LoadLibraryW` resolves the path
  again. Same trust base.
- **Absent** is still `kInjectionFailed`, not `kPayloadNotOurs`. A damaged install
  and a misuse of the ABI are different problems and must not share a reason.

> There is no override. No hidden setting, no config-file flag, no CLI switch, no "advanced users" escape hatch. If a user disagrees with a specific entry, the path is a GitHub issue against the rules file, reviewed in public — not a local bypass.

### The floor data cannot remove

**There was a local bypass, and this paragraph is the reason it no longer works
(§S21, fixed 2026-08-04).** It is recorded rather than quietly patched, because
the shape recurs: the sentence above was enforced against every channel anyone
had thought to check, and the gate's own data file was not one of them.

Two facts combined into an override:

- The rules path was built from `_dupenv_s("LOCALAPPDATA")`. The CRT environment
  is inherited from whoever launched the process, and in launch mode that is a
  shortcut, a `.bat`, or the Steam launch-option wrapper (`04_CAPTURE` §Launch
  mode). One variable chose the hard gate's only input, for one run.
- The completeness check validated that three family **names** existed in the
  right **groups** and never read their `values`.

So a twelve-line file naming `Easy Anti-Cheat`/modules, `BattlEye`/modules and
`Riot Vanguard`/drivers with values that match nothing parsed as valid, and the
guard returned `Allow` on a machine running Vanguard. No admin, no write to our
install directory, nothing left behind.

**The fix is §S8's mechanism applied to data instead of to symbols.** A token
that escapes can be ignored; a symbol that does not exist cannot be called; a
family that data cannot remove cannot be bypassed. `fl::guard::FloorFamilies`
carries the blocklist **inside the binary**, `ParseRules` seeds it before it
reads a byte of the file, and nothing merges, rewrites or removes it. The file
may add families and values. It can take nothing away.

Three consequences worth stating rather than discovering:

- **Path resolution is now `SHGetKnownFolderPath`, and that is a narrowing, not
  a guarantee.** A user can still move their own Local AppData. What is gone is
  the per-launch, per-process vector. The floor is what makes the residual
  harmless.
- **The completeness check still runs over the file's families only.** Checking
  the merged set would make it a gate that cannot fail, since the floor
  satisfies it by construction — so an empty or incomplete rules file still
  refuses, and still says so.
- **The floor is GENERATED from `rules/detection-rules.json` at build time**
  (`tools/gen-ac-floor.ps1`), so it is the whole shipped blocklist plus the
  heuristic's name fragments.

  > This paragraph used to read "the floor is deliberately three families, not
  > the whole blocklist", kept small because a larger hand-written table would be
  > a second blocklist drifting from the data. Measured, that bought **4 of the
  > seed's 22 values, 2 of its 5 groups and none of its 5 fragments** — so it
  > closed *"a crafted file makes the guard allow everything"* and left open
  > *"a crafted file removes most of the blocklist"*. Generating it removes the

  >
  > A file family identical to a floor entry is deduplicated, so the file's own
  > budget is half `kMaxFamilies` — `tools/rules-validate.ps1` checks that worst
  > case, and ctest `fl_rules_budget` asserts the generated floor reproduces the
  > shipped seed exactly.
- **The fuzzy tier is floored too**, which is what stops a rules file with no
  `heuristic` block from making it silently cease to exist. That was
  `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §S19(d), and a floor closes it without the new
  `ParseResult` cause that entry proposed — which would have made
  `kRulesIncomplete`'s signal a lie and driven `layer.cpp` to machine-wide inert
  passthrough.

### Blocklist seed

Matching is case-insensitive. **This table shows the literal tokens the data
carries, not glob patterns** — `rules/detection-rules.schema.json` rejects `*`
in a token outright, so a maintainer copying `EasyAntiCheat*.dll` out of an
earlier version of this table produced an entry that was matched *literally* and
therefore never fired. A silent hole in the blocklist, created by its own
normative documentation. Write tokens here exactly as the data must hold them.

The list is data, versioned in `detection-rules.json`, expandable without a release. Unknown-but-suspicious modules (filename containing one of the `nameFragments` — today `anticheat`, `antitamper`, `guard`, `protect` — plus unsigned-by-known-vendor) produce a **warn-and-refuse** with a "report this to us" link rather than silently allowing.

**The signer comparison uses the certificate subject's `O=` field, not `CN=`**
(`anticheat.heuristic.signerField`, a schema `const`). Measured 2026-08-02 on
Windows 11 26300: every WHQL-signed binary on the machine — *including the
NVIDIA display driver itself* — carries
`CN='Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility Publisher'`, which is not a vendor
name, while `O='Microsoft Corporation'`. Matching on `CN` would therefore make
the entire driver stack read as untrusted, and combined with the `guard` and
`protect` name fragments above that is a live false-refusal path, not a
theoretical one. A signature that is absent, invalid, or simply could not be
checked stays untrusted and refuses — that direction is deliberate.

Anti-cheat loading *after* injection (some titles load it late, or the user launched a multiplayer mode from a single-player menu) ⇒ **clean unhook on detection**, session finalized as `exit_status = unhooked_safety`, prominent UI notice. This is the single most important runtime behavior in the whole capture layer.

**Be honest about the window.** A 30 s poll means anti-cheat can be loaded for up to 30 s before we react — the unhook is immediate *once detected*, not immediate in absolute terms. Consent and disclaimer wording must say "within 30 seconds", never "immediately" (`legal/DISCLAIMER.md` §2). Whether to shrink the window, or to detect the load directly via the `LoadLibrary` hook `17_HOOK_ENGINE` §DLL entry **specifies** for lazily-loaded graphics DLLs, is `20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §S6.

> detour supplements the poll; it replaces nothing (§S6's own ruling).

> **This sentence used to say the hook "already exists and is currently unused", which was false.** Corrected 2026-08-04: the Overlay installs no hooks at all — `dllmain.cpp` exports one function and nothing in the tree calls `MH_CreateHook` outside a probe. §S6 is therefore downstream of the whole P1 hook layer, not "the cheapest available improvement to the most important behavior in the product". A reader planning work off this paragraph was being told a mechanism was sitting there ready.

### Elevated / protected targets

If `OpenProcess` with the needed rights fails (protected process, higher integrity), do **not** escalate creatively. Report "cannot attach" and offer Tier-2. Never attempt to acquire privileges beyond running the Agent elevated at the user's explicit request.

## User-facing consent

Enabling hooking is a **per-game** action, gated by a one-time dialog per game that states, in plain language:

- what gets injected and why (measuring the real render resolution, upscaler, frame generation and ray tracing state — which passive measurement cannot do accurately),
- that anti-cheat systems may flag or ban accounts, and that FrameLedger refuses to inject where it detects one but **cannot guarantee it knows every anti-cheat**,
- that the user is responsible for the terms of service of the games they play,
- **what happens if they do not enable it**: FrameLedger still records the session — its start,
  end and duration, and whatever hardware telemetry the machine provides — and every
  frame-derived value on that session reads `N/A` (FR-4.9). That is Tier 2. It is what every game
  gets until it is individually enabled, and it needs no injection and no elevation.

Consent is stored per game (`games.hook_consent_at`), **stamped by the Agent, never supplied by a client** (`07_IPC` §The pipe is not a trust boundary). Wording lives in `.resx` and is reviewed with the same care as the legal documents.

> **The Agent stamps one since 2026-09-10 (P2 PR-F, HANDOFF §P2 decision D4):** `FrameLedger.Agent --console

The default for every newly added game is **hooking off — Tier 2**. Nothing is ever injected because the user merely added a game.

### A game already enabled can become blocked later

FR-2.2 disables the toggle for titles that ship anti-cheat, and FR-2.3 refuses at
runtime — but neither says what happens to a game the user enabled *before* it
started matching. A patch adds anti-cheat, or a rules update newly covers it.
Leaving `hook_enabled = 1` in that state is the dangerous reading, and it is the
one the documents used to permit by omission (`20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §S11).

**The static pre-scan re-runs on every rules update and on every change to the
game's executable** (path, size or mtime). If it now matches:

1. `hook_enabled` is forced to `0`.
2. `hook_blocked_reason` is set — the column already exists (`06_DATA_MODEL`
   §games), so this needs no schema change, and a non-null value already means
   "toggle disabled in the UI".
3. `hook_consent_at` is **preserved**. The user did consent; the block is not a
   withdrawal of consent and must not silently require them to consent again if
   the title is later cleared.
4. The UI shows a persistent notice, not a transient toast — the user needs to
   understand why a game they enabled stopped being captured at Tier 1.

A rules update that *removes* a match does **not** re-enable hooking on its own.
Turning it back on is a user action, because re-enabling silently would mean the
rules feed can switch injection on for a game without anyone looking.

## Crash & stability safety

- Two crashes of the same game within 60 s of injection ⇒ hooking auto-disabled for that game, UI explains, Tier-2 takes over. Recorded in `games.hook_autodisabled_reason`.
- The Overlay DLL self-disables after 3 faults in hook bodies (`17_HOOK_ENGINE` §Fault policy) and reports it.
- Every hooked session writes a breadcrumb file before injection; if the game process dies before the first frame record arrives, the next run is recorded as suspect.

## Honest limits to document to users

The Disclaimer states these explicitly, and the UI consent dialog echoes them:

1. The blocklist cannot be complete. New anti-cheat systems appear; a game can add one in a patch.
2. Some anti-tamper (Denuvo) reacts to injection even in single-player titles — usually a crash, not a ban, but it can also mean lost play time.
3. Even a perfectly behaved tool can be flagged by heuristics.
4. FrameLedger's authors cannot restore a banned account. The refusal guard exists to make this unlikely; it is not a warranty.

## Review checklist for any capture-layer PR

- [ ] Does this hook read anything beyond the arguments of the API it hooks? → reject
- [ ] Does this make FrameLedger harder for anti-cheat to identify? → reject
- [ ] Does this add a path to inject without passing the guard? → reject
- [ ] Is the new hook listed in `17_HOOK_ENGINE` §Hook inventory with a stated purpose?
- [ ] Does the hook body allocate, lock, log, or throw? → reject
- [ ] Does the session record `N/A` rather than a fabricated value when this hook is unavailable (FR-4.9), and does it record WHY? *(The old item asked whether a Tier-2 degradation path exists. Under a two-rung ladder the answer is always yes, so it was a box that could not fail — the defect class this document keeps recording.)*
