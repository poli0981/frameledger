> `*` **`AntiCheatGuard` is a facade, not an implementation.** The guard is

> the L1 + L2 + L3 composite; `SessionRecorder` is `Application.Recording`. The named pipe on the left

## Why this shape

- **Hooking in-process is the only way to get the facts we care about.** Render resolution vs output resolution, upscaler identity and quality preset, whether frame generation is actually running, whether rays are actually being traced — none of these are observable from outside the process. The previous ETW-only design could only guess from file/module presence, which measured badly against real games.
- **The DLL does as little as possible.** It records; it does not analyze, log, allocate, or block. All interpretation happens in the Agent. This keeps the game-side risk surface tiny and the overhead near zero.
- **Shared memory, not pipes, on the hot path.** A present hook must not make a syscall. It writes 64 bytes into a ring and returns.
- **The Agent no longer needs elevation for its primary path.** Injecting into a same-integrity process, and reading GPU telemetry through vendor user-mode APIs, both work unprivileged. Elevation is *optional* and unlocks: CPU/board temperatures (LHM + PawnIO) and attaching to games that themselves run elevated. ~~and the Tier-2 ETW source~~ — **and as of 2026-08-28 the honest consequence this sentence used to carry is gone with it.** It read: *"the fallback tier is the part that needs elevation, so an unelevated Agent whose Tier-1 attempt fails degrades to Tier 3, not Tier 2"*. There is no ETW tier and no Tier 3, so **no capture tier needs elevation at all** (`04_CAPTURE` §Frame source abstraction).

## Capture tiers

| Tier | Mechanism | Gets you | When used |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | Injected hooks (default when the user enabled it and the guard passed) | Everything: exact render/output res, upscaler + quality, FG ground truth, RT/PT evidence, per-process VRAM, PSO stutter attribution, Reflex latency, present flags | Offline/single-player titles the user opted in |
| **2** | None | **Session duration, whatever hardware telemetry this machine can provide, and the REASON there is nothing else** — which check refused, or that the hook failed, was not enabled, or the target is 32-bit. Every measured field reads `N/A` (FR-4.9) | Guard refused, hook failed, user chose not to hook, or a target the Overlay structurally cannot enter |

Tier is recorded per session (`sessions.capture_tier`) and shown in the UI, because metric availability differs and comparing across tiers must be explicit.

## Injection flow

```
watcher sees tracked exe launch
  → is hooking enabled for this game?           no → Tier 2 (nothing measured)
  → AntiCheatGuard.Check(pid)                   fail → refuse + explain + Tier 2 (19_SAFETY)
  → Injector.Attach(pid, dllPath)               fail → log + Tier 2
      OpenProcess(CREATE_THREAD|VM_OPERATION|VM_WRITE|VM_READ|QUERY_LIMITED)
      VirtualAllocEx → WriteProcessMemory(dllPath) → CreateRemoteThread(LoadLibraryW)
  → DLL init thread: install hooks, create ring, publish handshake block
  → Agent maps Local\FrameLedger.Ring.<pid>, validates layout version + build id
  → first frame record → session starts
```

**Launch mode (preferred when FrameLedger starts the game):** `CreateProcess(CREATE_SUSPENDED)` → guard → inject → `ResumeThread`. This catches swapchain creation and early upscaler init, which attach mode can miss. Attach mode remains for games launched from Steam/GOG directly.

> **Built 2026-09-06 as start → the guard waits for a presentation runtime → the full guard → inject**
> (`FlGuardedInjectWhenReady`, P1 item 2), because a suspended target has loaded nothing for the module
> scan to read (`20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §S1). What it costs is measured by the session itself:
> `FlWriterState.dxgiPresentsBeforeHook`. `04_CAPTURE` §Launch mode carries the shape.

Guard re-runs every 30 s for the life of the session; anti-cheat appearing late ⇒ clean unhook (`19_SAFETY` §During a session).

## Lifecycle

- Agent idles at ~0% CPU: 1 Hz process poll. No capture machinery exists until a tracked game launches.
- Session ends when the process tree exits, or on safety unhook, or on user stop.
- The DLL is **not unloaded** from a live process after unhooking (threads may still be inside trampolines). It disables its hooks, stops writing, and goes dormant until the process exits. Documented, deliberate.
- UI exit does not stop the Agent when background capture is enabled; otherwise UI sends `Shutdown`.
- Single instance via named mutexes; the ring name is per-PID so multiple games can be captured simultaneously (rare but supported).

## Failure domains

| Failure | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Anti-cheat detected pre-injection | Refuse, explain which signal fired, offer Tier 2 |
| Anti-cheat detected mid-session | Immediate clean unhook, `exit_status = unhooked_safety`, prominent notice |
| Injection API fails (access denied, protected process) | Log, no retry loop, offer Tier 2 + "run Agent elevated" hint — elevation here is about *attaching to an elevated target*, not about reaching a tier; Tier 2 needs none |
| Hook faults 3× | DLL self-disables, sets fault flag in handshake block, Agent finalizes session as `degraded` |
| Game crashes ≤ 60 s after injection, twice | Hooking auto-disabled for that game, Tier 2 takes over |
| Ring overflow (Agent stalled) | Overwrite-oldest; dropped count published in the ring header → session flagged with a data-quality warning |
| Layout/version mismatch DLL ↔ Agent | Agent refuses to attach, tells user to restart the game after update |
| Vendor API unavailable (no NVAPI etc.) | GPU telemetry degrades to `N/A`; frame metrics unaffected |
| DB locked/corrupt | Integrity check + backup-and-recreate in Tools |

## Key design decisions (ADR)

- **ADR-1 (superseded):** ~~Passive ETW only; injection out of scope.~~ Replaced by ADR-7.
- **ADR-2:** WPF over WinUI 3 — Velopack maturity, ecosystem stability, portfolio reuse.
- **ADR-3 (revised three times, and this one retires it):** ~~ETW is the **Tier-2 fallback**, not the primary source.~~ **There is no ETW tier.** Owner decision 2026-08-28: the ladder is two rungs — hooked, or not measured — and Tier 2 carries duration, sensors and the reason. The abstraction below survives; the second implementation it was justified by never existed and is now not planned. ~~ETW/PresentMon~~ — the **tool** is no longer named: §S31 retired PresentMon's `FrameType` as an oracle on 2026-08-20–27 and the owner dropped it on 2026-08-27, so Tier 2 has a tier and no implementation. The `IFrameSource` abstraction that made this cheap to change is retained and **vindicated a second time**: the mechanism changed underneath it and no consumer moved.
- **ADR-4:** Raw frame series stored as compressed blobs with retention; aggregates kept forever.
- **ADR-5 (revised):** In-game overlay is now *possible* (we are already in the process) and is planned as an opt-in feature after the data path is stable — see `15_ROADMAP` P5.
- **ADR-6:** UI toolkit = WPF UI (lepoco `Wpf.Ui` ≥ 4.3.0, MIT) — see `16_WPFUI_SYNTAX.md`.
- **ADR-7 (2026-07, core change):** **Capture moves to in-process graphics-API hooking**, C++20 DLL + MinHook, with a Vulkan implicit layer for Vulkan. Rationale: passive detection of DLSS/upscaling/frame-generation/RT state showed large errors against real games; those states are only knowable at the API boundary. Trade-offs accepted: anti-cheat exposure (mitigated by the hard guard in `19_SAFETY`, offline titles only), crash risk in the host process (mitigated by SEH guards + fault policy + auto-disable), a second toolchain in the build, and per-API maintenance as vendors change SDKs. Scope limited to titles the user explicitly opts in.
- **ADR-8:** **No evasion, ever** (`19_SAFETY` §What we will never build). This is an architectural constraint, not a preference — it defines what "correct" means for this codebase.
- **ADR-9:** Elevation demoted from required to optional; the Agent runs as a standard user by default.
