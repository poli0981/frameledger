# 06 — Data model (SQLite)

`%LOCALAPPDATA%\FrameLedger\ledger.db`. Pragmas: `journal_mode=WAL`, `synchronous=NORMAL`, `foreign_keys=ON`, `busy_timeout=5000`. `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` + Dapper; all writes in explicit transactions.

**Writer ownership:** Agent writes `sessions`, `session_segments`, `frame_blobs`, `sensor_blobs`, `hardware_snapshots`, and the hook-state columns on `games`. UI writes `games` (user-editable fields), `session_annotations`, `settings`, `legal_acceptance`. Both read everything.

## Schema (v2 — hook architecture)

> **`src/FrameLedger.Infrastructure/Persistence/Migrations/0001_init.sql` is normative since 2026-09-09
> (P2 PR-B).** The block below is the shape as drafted and is kept for its comments; the script adds
> what this document had no column for, each with the reason beside it in the script:
>
> - `sessions.session_guid` (UNIQUE) — the identity the `.partial` file, the pipe and recovery key on
>   (`20_OPEN_QUESTIONS` §G "Session identity"); `qpc_epoch` + `qpc_frequency` — the time base the
>   blobs and sensor series are aligned to (`03_METRICS` §Export, §Sensor aggregates);
>   `capture_mode` (`attach|launch`); the drain's own accounting (`drain_ticks`, `foreground_ticks`,
>   `records_before_attach`, `dxgi_presents_before_hook`, `gap_count`, `guard_ticks_published`,
>   `launch_wait_ms`); the 2026-09 metric additions (`presented_fps` + `presented_qualifier`,
>   `dxgi_unseen_total` / `dxgi_present_samples` / `displayed_counted_by`, `sl_tag_census`,
>   `sl_interposer_version`, `upscaler_driver_reported` / `fg_driver_reported` / `ngx_driver_words`,
>   `fg_none_withheld_reason`, `runtime_modules`, `executable_markers`, `writer_status_at_end`,
>   `early_stop_family`, `loader_signals`).
> - `games.exe_size_bytes` / `exe_mtime_ms` (the `ExecutableFingerprint`),
>   `hook_consent_provenance` (the `ConsentProvenance` NAME, default `NotRecorded`),
>   `hook_consent_disclosure_version`, **`hook_prescan_state`** (`not_run|clean|blocked|unverified` —
>   the third state one nullable `hook_blocked_reason` could not carry; nothing in P2 clears the
>   reason, per the owner question below), `hook_autodisabled_at`, `hook_last_injected_at`.
> - `frame_blobs.frame_index`, `swapchain_ids`; `sensor_blobs` gains the `t_ms` series.
> - **`fg_source`'s domain is `api|cadence|none|manual`, NULL = not measured** — this document said
>   `api|cadence|manual` while `03_METRICS` names rung 4 `none`; the CHECK carries the union.
> - **Every `*_at` / `*_ms` INTEGER is unix-ms UTC** (CLAUDE.md §Coding conventions), stated in the
>   script because it was stated nowhere in this file. QPC never leaves the pipeline except
>   `qpc_epoch` / `qpc_frequency`.
> - `exe_path` is `UNIQUE COLLATE NOCASE`, because consent matches `OrdinalIgnoreCase` on the
>   normalised full path and the index must agree with the lookup.

## Comparison safety

Because Tier-1 and Tier-2 sessions carry different fields, every query that compares sessions **must** filter or group by `capture_tier`. **Since 2026-08-28 the difference is total rather than partial** — a Tier-2 session has no frame data at all — so a mixed-tier overlay is not a degraded comparison, it is a comparison with nothing on one side. The Compare view refuses to overlay mixed tiers without an explicit "compare across tiers anyway" acknowledgement, and marks the chart accordingly. Likewise `settings_changed_midsession = 1` sessions are excluded from trend lines by default (they average across a settings change and are misleading), with a toggle to include them.

## Blob encoding

`float32`/`uint16`/`uint32` little-endian arrays through `DeflateStream` (Optimal). One hour at 100 fps ≈ 360k frames ≈ 1.4 MB raw frametimes ≈ **≤ 0.7 MB stored**; flags compress far better; render-res only stored when it varies. Decode helpers in `Infrastructure.Blobs` with round-trip test

> **Two rules the finalizer applies (2026-09-10, P2 PR-D).** `frametimes[i]` is the interval from the previous
> record ON THE SAME SWAPCHAIN; the first record of a stream, and any record after a torn slot or an
> overwrite skip, carries 0 with the `frame_flags` gap bit set, so the statistics exclude it and the export
> still reconstructs `qpc_ms`. `swapchain_ids` is present only when the session held more than one stream.
> Sensor series are aligned to `t_ms` (milliseconds from `qpc_epoch`) and a tick with no reading is stored as
> **−1** — never 0, which would be a reading — because temperatures, loads, power and memory are never negative.s (NaN forbidden — assert).

## The `.partial` file

> **Built 2026-09-10 (P2 PR-D), as HANDOFF §P2 pre-committed it.** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FrameLedger\tmp\<sessionGuid>.partial`
> (the unshipped host: `tmp\` beside its binary, decision D5), one per session, append-only, written at every
> state transition and every flush interval (60 s), deleted by the finalize's success, read by recovery at the
> next start. Format: `chunk := u32 type | u32 length | payload | u32 crc32(type ‖ length ‖ payload)`,
> little-endian, and **the valid prefix wins** — the reader stops at the first chunk that is short or fails
> its check, so a kill at any byte loses at most the chunk being written (`PartialSessionFileTests` kills
> at every offset of a fixture and asserts exactly the complete chunks survive). The file is flushed to the
> OS after every chunk; the threat is the Agent dying, not the machine losing power.
>
> | type | payload | when |
> |---|---|---|
> | 1 `Header` | UTF-8 JSON: format version, `session_guid`, `started_at`, `qpc_epoch`/`qpc_frequency`, `game_id`, `snapshot_id`, exe path, pid, tier, mode, Overlay build id, telemetry descriptor, launch wait | on create — the breadcrumb `19_SAFETY` §Crash safety asks for before injection |
> | 2 `Records` | `i64` first ordinal, then N raw `FlFrameRecord` (64 B each); a chunk that does not continue the sequence is refused | each flush |
> | 3 `Gaps` | N × `i32` gap-before record indices | each flush |
> | 4 `Sensors` | N × one telemetry sample: QPC, wall clock, layer, presence mask, then only the fields that carry a value — null stays null | each flush |
> | 5 `Tick` | drain/foreground ticks, dropped, gaps, guard ticks, wall clock, the raw `FlWriterState`; the last one wins | each flush |
> | 6 `Note` | wall clock + UTF-8 text: a state transition | each transition |
> | 7 `Touches` | N × `i64` QPC at which the host touched the target | each flush |
>
> Recovery (`PartialRecovery`): a file whose guid is already a row is deleted (the finalize had landed);
> one under the minimum session length is discarded; one with no readable header is dropped; the rest
> become `interrupted` rows ended at the last flush (or the last record's clock), with every measured
> column computed from the prefix exactly as a live finalize would. **Rejected:** a `sessions_in_progress`
> table — a blob churn every minute, a lock fight with the UI in P3, and `04_CAPTURE` had already named a
> file under `tmp\`.

## Retention

Default: raw blobs for the **last 20 sessions per game** (configurable N or unlimited). Aggregates and segments kept forever. Sweep at finalize + on demand (Tools → DB maintenance, which also offers `PRAGMA integrity_check`, `VACUUM`, backup).

## Migrations

Sequential embedded SQL (`Migrations/0001_init.sql`, `0002_*.sql`, …), applied at startup by whichever process opens the DB first, guarded by `schema_migrations` + a named mutex. Never edit an applied script; only append.

> **Built 2026-09-09 (P2 PR-B):** `Infrastructure.Persistence.MigrationRunner` over scripts embedded in
> the assembly (so the schema a build applies is the one it was tested against), one transaction per
> script, under `Local\FrameLedger.Ledger.Migrate` — session-local rather than `Global\`, because the
> Agent and the UI share a session and the global namespace asks for a privilege a standard user need
> not hold. **A ledger at a version newer than the build's scripts is refused, not read**
> (`LedgerSchemaException`): guessing at a schema we do not understand is the one option that could
> turn a newer file into wrong answers. `LedgerDatabase` opens with the four pragmas above, one
> connection per process behind a gate, and every write in an explicit transaction — a failing blob
> insert leaves no session row behind (`SqliteSessionRepositoryTests`).

**`0001_init.sql` creates the schema above directly.** There is no v1 → v2
upgrade path, because there is no released v1: nothing has shipped, so no
FrameLedger database exists anywhere in the world. Writing and testing a
migration from a schema that never existed is work with no user on the other end
of it. The `schema_migrations` machinery still ships from day one — it is what
makes the *next* migration safe, and `11_UPDATER` §Versioning already requires
migrations to cover every released `MAJOR-1`. That obligation begins at the first
release, not before it.

## Hardware change markers (FR-6.3)

Snapshot captured per session, hashed, deduped. Trend queries join consecutive sessions' snapshots; differing fields emit a marker `{after_session_id, field, old, new}`. GPU driver version now comes from the vendor API (`18_GPU_VENDOR_APIS`) rather than WMI, which makes it accurate enough to be worth charting.
