<#
.SYNOPSIS
    FrameLedger local quality gate. CI runs this identical script, so local and
    CI can never disagree (docs/12_BUILD.md §Local quality gate).

.DESCRIPTION
    ./build.ps1 check    the full pre-push gate (see docs/12_BUILD.md for the list)
    ./build.ps1 native   native build only
    ./build.ps1 managed  managed build + tests only
    ./build.ps1 format   apply formatting instead of verifying it

    Gates that are not yet implemented SKIP LOUDLY. A gate that silently passes
    because its tool does not exist is worse than no gate: it reads as "checked"
    in CI output when nothing was checked.

<#
Clear an ambient Platform variable before any MSBuild invocation.

Anything that sets up MSVC exports Platform=x64 for .vcxproj builds — vcvars64
does, and so does ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd on CI. We have no vcxproj, and MSBuild
reads the variable as a SOLUTION platform, so `dotnet build FrameLedger.slnx`
fails with:

    MSB4126: The specified solution configuration "Release|x64" is invalid

which has no visible connection to having set up a C++ toolchain. Project-level
x64 comes from Directory.Build.props.

This is deliberately its own function, called unconditionally before the managed
build, rather than living at the end of Import-MsvcEnvironment. That function
returns early when cl.exe is already on PATH — which is exactly the CI case,
because the MSVC action ran first. Local runs passed and CI failed on precisely
that difference.

<#
Import the MSVC x64 environment into this process so the native build works
from an ordinary shell, not only from a Developer Command Prompt.

Two things this has to get right:

1. Finding the install. vswhere's -requires filter for the C++ workload does
   not match every VS edition/channel — it silently returned nothing on a
   machine that had the tools installed — so fall back to probing for
   vcvars64.bat directly.

2. PATH hygiene. vcvars64 PREPENDS to whatever PATH it inherits. On a machine
   with msys2/MinGW on PATH, CMake then discovers MinGW's `ld.exe` as the
   linker (MSVC ships `link.exe`, so there is nothing to shadow it) and the
   build dies with "cannot find /nologo: No such file or directory" — a
   confusing failure a long way from its cause. Starting from a minimal PATH
   is what a Developer Command Prompt effectively gives you.
